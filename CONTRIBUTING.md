# Contributing to Azure Communication Services UI Library

## Getting started

To get up and running making changes in the repo, check out our [guide on making a contribution](<./docs/contributing-guide/1. getting-set-up.md>)

## Contribution policy

A “Contribution” is work voluntarily submitted to a project. This submitted work can include code, documentation, design, answering questions, or submitting and triaging issues.

Many contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to grant and do grant the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit [https://cla.microsoft.com](https://cla.microsoft.com).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot automatically determines if you need to provide a CLA and decorates the pull request appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Follow the instructions provided by the bot. You only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## Acceptance and consensus seeking process

Acceptance of contributions follows the consensus-seeking process.

All pull requests must be approved by a *collaborator* before the pull request can be accepted.

Before a pull request is accepted, time should be given to receive input from *collaborators* or *code owners* with the expertise to evaluate the changes. The amount of time can vary but at least 3 days during the typical working week and 5 days over weekends should be given to account for international time differences and work schedules.

When a pull request : (a) has a significant impact on the project, (b) is inherently controversial, or (c) has not reached consensus with *collaborators*; add a "controversial" label to the pull request for the *steering committee* to review the pull request. Pull requests labeled with "controversial" are not approved until the *steering committee* reviews the issue and makes a decision.

Additionally, *owners*, can temporarily enable [interaction limits](https://help.github.com/articles/limiting-interactions-with-your-repository/) to allow a "cool-down" period when hot topics become disruptive.

Specific *collaborators* or *code owners*  can be added to a pull request by including their user alias.

## Stability policy

An essential consideration in every pull request is its impact on the system. To manage impacts, we work collectively to ensure that we do not introduce unnecessary breaking changes, performance or functional regressions, or negative impacts on usability for users or supported partners.
