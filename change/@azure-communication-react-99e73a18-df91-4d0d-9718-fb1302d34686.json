  "comment": "We are excited to announce that the Azure Communication Services Web UI Library now supports the Soft Mute feature. This feature enables users to mute other users in a call. If a user has been soft muted, they retain the ability to unmute themselves. Developers can use this functionality today through our composites (e.g CallComposite, CallWithChatComposite).",
