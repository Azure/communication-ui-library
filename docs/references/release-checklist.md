# Release Checklist

## Before Release

Before we release a new version or beta version the following checklist should be completed:

* ✅ Package version updates
  * Ensure packages to be released have the correct version number
* ✅ Release documentation
  * Ensure changelogs have been generated for the released packages
* ✅ Manual and automated tests pass
  * See [Test Plan](#test-plan) below.
* ✅ All translations have been updated
  * Ensure that strings for both components and composites have complete translations.
  * If necessary, merge translations into `main` and cherry-pick updated translations to release branch.
* ✅ APIs
  * Ensure no breaking changes to the public APIs
  * Ensure new API changes have sign off from the Azure Review Board

**Releasing is an irreversible action, double check everything is in order before releasing.**

## After Release

* ✅ Verify npm package
  * Ensure the new package is available on npm
  * Ensure the new package has the correct tag (latest, next or dev)
  * Download the package and ensure the bits inside are the same as the ones you intended to publish
  * Use the npm package in a sample app to smoke test there are no issues installing and ingesting the package off npm
* ✅ Verify documentation
  * Ensure the documentation on the public storybook site matches the latest release.
  * Open the storybook site and ensure the console log that lists the npm package version number matches the released package version number.
* ✅ Post about release on the [internal releases Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae12aa149c0b44318b245ae8c30365880%40thread.skype/ACS%2520Deployment%2520Announcements?groupId=3e9c1fc3-39df-4486-a26a-456d80e80f82&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).
