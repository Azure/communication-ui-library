# String translations

[@azure/communication-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/communication-react) includes translations of all strings used internally to a set of supported languages.

We use a Microsoft internal translation service for string translations. Strings are automatically sent for translation via a [GitHub action](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/actions/workflows/run-td-build.yml) on pushes to the `main` and release branches.

**Strings are not committed back into the repository automatically**. This is to avoid surprises due to mis-translated strings and so that test snapshots can be updated to reflect the new strings.

To fetch back strings:

* Create a new branch off of `main` (or the release branch when fetching strings into a release) and trigger the same [GitHub action](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/actions/workflows/run-td-build.yml).
  * **Note**: When fetching strings for a release branch, create the branch directly off the release branch. The fetched strings depend on the english strings in the branch that triggers the workflow, so translating the strings on `main` and then cherry-picking over the PR can result in the wrong strings getting translated.
* Pick your new branch to run the workflow and check the option to commit updated strings.

* You _may_ need to add the `ui change` label to update [e2e test snapshots](../references/ui-tests.md).
* Follow the [usual process](../contributing-guide/6.%20submitting-a-pr.md) for merging the PR into `main` or the release branch.

**Note**: String translation can take up to 5 working days to complete. Be careful when making (i.e., cherry-picking into a release branch) string changes close to a release.
