## 4. Testing your changes

The key ways to test your changes are:

* Unit tests (see [5. Writing unit tests](./5.%20writing-unit-tests.md))
* In the sample apps (see [3. Running a Sample or Storybook](./3.%20running-a-sample-or-storybook.md))
* In Storybook for UI component changes (see [3. Running a Sample or Storybook](./3.%20running-a-sample-or-storybook.md))

### Testing changes in your own app

A common scenario is that you encountered a bug in your own app and are looking to submit a fix, but want to test the fix works in your own app. In order to test changes made in this repo inside your own app follow the following process:

1. Make your changes to the necessary packages in this repo
1. Build those packages using the rush command `rush build -t "package-name"`
1. Npm pack your changes to migrate them to your repo
    * Run npm pack in the package directory

      ```bash
      # inside the root of the package you wish to test in your app
      npm pack
      ```

    * This will produce a tarball file `package-name.tar.gz`

1. Copy and paste this tarball into your app's root directory
1. Install the tarball as a dependency in your app:

    ```bash
    npm install "package-name.tar.gz"
      ```

1. You will need to repeat this process for each package you have made changes to
