## 7. Having your changes published ðŸš€

Once your PR has completed your changes are ready to be published in a new version! We do manual publishes of new package versions semi-regularly, as well as alpha packages nightly. If you are looking to test your changes as soon as possible in your app we recommend installing the alpha version and verifying your changes before we release a new non-alpha version of the package.

### New Version Release Cadence

We aim to publish new versions of the packages every 2-8 weeks once an appropriate alpha version has been fully tested.

### Nightly alpha builds

We publish new alpha versions nightly to npm. These can be installed and tested as soon as they are published.
