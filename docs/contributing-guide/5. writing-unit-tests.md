## 5. Writing unit tests

Our unit tests are written using [Jest](../infrastructure/jest.md).

### Tips for writing unit tests

* All unit tests must be in a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` file - jest will automatically pick up these files and run them.
* Unit tests must be well named and test only one thing per test.
* Unit tests must follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern, e.g.

  ```javascript
  test("addOne function should add one to a given number", () => {
      // Arrange
      const givenNumber = 5;

      // Act
      const result = addOne(givenNumber);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(6);
  });
  ```

  * This ensures good structure to unit tests making them easily understandable for the developer who needs to take a look at them when they do not pass.
* UI components must have snapshot tests (see [Generating new snapshots](<./6. submitting-a-pr.md#generating-new-snapshots-for-your-ui-changes>))

### Running unit tests

To run unit tests for the package or sample you are in:

```bash
rushx test # run this from the package directory
```

To run all unit tests for the whole repo

```bash
rush test # this can be run from anywhere
```
