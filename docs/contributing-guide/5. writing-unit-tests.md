## 5. Writing unit tests

Our unit tests are written using [Jest](../infrastructure/jest.md).

### Tips for writing unit tests
* All unit tests must be in a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` file - jest will automatically pick up these files and run them.
* Unit tests must be well named and test only one thing per test.
* Unit tests must follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern, e.g.
    ```javascript
    test("addOne function should add one to a given number", () => {
        // Arrange
        const givenNumber = 5;

        // Act
        const result = addOne(givenNumber);

        // Assert
        expect(result).toEqual(6);
    });
    ```
    * This ensures good structure to unit tests making them easily understandable for the developer who needs to take a look at them when they do not pass.
* UI components must have snapshot tests (see _Update test snapshots_ below)

### Running unit tests

To run unit tests for the package or sample you are in:
```bash
rushx test # run this from the package directory
```

To run all unit tests for the whole repo
```bash
rush test # this can be run from anywhere
```

### Update test snapshots
If you have made changes to a UI components, or added a new UI component, you will need to update the snapshots.

For more information on what snapshots are see the official Jest documentation: https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing. 

To update snapshots after changing a UI component, in your package directory, run:
```bash
rushx snapshot:update
```
