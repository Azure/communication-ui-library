## 1. Getting Set up

### Prerequisites

- Ensure node is installed. [Node.js (16.19.0 and above)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- (Recommended) install vscode. [Visual Studio Code (Stable Build)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- Install [rush](https://rushjs.io/), in a terminal of your choosing, run:

    ```bash
    npm i -g @microsoft/rush
    ```

### Cloning the repo

Clone the repo: [https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library)

```bash
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library.git

# SSH
git clone git@github.com:Azure/communication-ui-library.git
```

### Installing dependencies

Navigate to your cloned repo and install dependencies for all packages and samples:

```bash
# navigate to the repository
cd communication-ui-library/

# install dependencies
rush update
```

> note: this may take a long time the first time it runs

# FAQ
If you are running into issues such as "Filename too long" when setting up the repo.
e.g

`error: cannot stat 'packages/react-composites/tests/browser/snapshots/stable/tests/browser/callwithchat/CallWithChatComposite.test.ts-snapshots/call-with-chat-more-drawer-new-selected-microphone-screen-Mobile-Android-Portrait-linux.png': Filename too long`

We suggest running this command

`git config --system core.longpaths true`

or without --system
`git config core.longpaths true`
