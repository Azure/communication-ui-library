## 2. Building Samples and Packages

### Building a specific sample or package

To build and sample or package, _and all of its dependencies_, run:

```bash
rush build -t "package-name" # run this from anywhere
```

You can find package names at the top of the `rush.json`.

If you have built the package and all its dependencies and subsequently only want to rebuild the package you have made changes to, run:

```bash
rushx build # run this from the package/sample directory you're looking to build
```

### Building the whole repo

To build the whole repo you can run:

```bash
rush build # run this from any directory inside the repo
```

> note: this will take a long time the first time it is run
