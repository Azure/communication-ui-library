## 2. Building Samples and Packages

### Building a specific sample or package

To build and sample or package, _and all of its dependencies_, run:

```bash
rush build -t "package-name" # run this from anywhere
```

You can find Package names at the top of the package.json.

If you have built the package and all its dependencies and subsequently only want to rebuild the package you have made changes to, run:

```bash
rushx build # run this from the package/sample directory you're looking to build
```

### Building the whole repo

To build the whole repo you can run:

```bash
rush build # run this from any directory inside the repo
```

> note: this will take a long time the first time it is run
