## 2. Building Samples and Packages

### Building the whole repo

To build the whole repo you can run:

```bash
rush build # this can be run from any directory inside the repo
```

> note: this may take a long time the first time it is run

### Building a specific sample or package

To build and sample or package, _and all of its dependencies_, run:

```bash
rush build -t "package-name" # this can be run from anywhere
```

The package name can be found at the top of the package.json.

If you have built the package and all its dependencies and subsequently only want to rebuild the package you have made changes to, run:

```bash
rushx build # this must be run from the package/sample directory you're looking to build
```
