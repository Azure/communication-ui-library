## 3. Running a Sample or Storybook

### Running one of the sample apps

To run one of the samples first input your Azure resource connection string.

* Under `samples\Server\appsettings.json` replace `"REPLACE_WITH_CONNECTION_STRING"` with your connection string.

Then navigate to the sample directory and type the run command:

```bash
# Navigate to one of the sample directories, e.g. `Calling`
cd samples\Calling

# Start the sample
rushx start
```

Running a sample kicks off a number of commands:

1. Starts the Sample's webpack-dev-server
    * This hosts the app by default at `localhost:3000`
1. Starts the Sample's API server
    * This server is located `Samples/server`
    * This runs by default at `localhost:8080`
1. Starts a dependency `build:watch` command to hot reload any changes made to packages.

Once the webpack-dev-server has started it should open the webpage for the sample, and once the sample has finished building the webpage will finish loading and the sample will be ready.
> note: this may take a long time the first time it runs

### Running Storybook

If you are making changes to the pure UI components, you will want to verify your change in Storybook, as well as potentially updating the corresponding story for that UI component.

To run storybook navigate to the storybook directory and type the storybook start command:

```bash
# Navigate to the storybook directory
cd packages\communication-ui

# Ensure the storybook dependencies are built
rush build -t "@azure/communication-ui"

# Start Storybook
rushx storybook
```
