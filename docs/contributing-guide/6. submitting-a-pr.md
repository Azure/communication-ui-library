## 6. Submitting a PR

### Prerequisites to publishing a Pull Request
Once you have gotten setup with the repo, made and tested your changes, there is one more check before submitting your PR:

#### Generate a change file to describe your changes
To ensure we have high quality changelogs going forward and make sure your contribution does not go unaccredited for we ask you to create a change file to describe your changes. To generate the change file first make sure all your changes are committed, then run:
```bash
rush changelog
```

This will start an interactive tool that will:
1. First ask you to select whether your change is a Major, Minor or Patch (for more information on what to choose see: https://semver.org/)

1. Then ask for a short description of your change - this is what will be included in the changelog when a new version is released so keep it concise and meaningful.

It will ask you these questions for each package you have made changes to.

Once that is done commit these change files and include them in your PR.

### Submitting your PR

You're ready to submit your PR! 🚀 Thank you for your contribution!

Once you have submitted your PR it must pass a number of automated checks that help keep our packages and repo healthy. As of writing, the following checks must pass:
* ✅ At least 2 reviewers must approve the changes
* ✅ All packages, samples and storybook must build successfully
* ✅ Unit tests must all pass
* ✅ Linting must succeed without warnings
* ✅ Change file must be submitted
* ✅ Check for public API regressions must not fail
