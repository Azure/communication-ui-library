# Pull Requests

## PR Gates

We have a number of different gates used to validate a Pull Request before it is merged into main.
As of writing, the following must pass without warnings:

* ✅ At least 2 reviewers
* ✅ Builds (all packages, samples and storybook)
* ✅ Unit tests
* ✅ Linting
* ✅ Change file check (see ./beachball.md for more information)
* ✅ API changes check (see ./api-extractor.md for more information)

The github action can be found at [.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

### Upcoming API PR Gate

While we are public preview, we accept there will be breaking changes. Once we hit general release (v1.0.0) we will no longer allow breaking changes. After general release we will block any changes to the public api file. This means any new functionality that is being exported must be tagged [@beta](https://api-extractor.com/pages/tsdoc/tag_beta/). Once we are ready to export the functionality marked `beta`, we will mark all such functionality as `public` and pull those changes in to the public `api.md` files accordingly.

## PR Templates

We use a PR template file to provide quick guidance on how to write a descriptive PR description to help facilitate quality reviewing. This file can be found and updated at [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
