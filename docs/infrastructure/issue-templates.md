# Issue Templates

We have a couple of issue templates to help fast-track support on issues. They dictate the options available here: <https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/issues/new/choose>

## Bug Template

We use a Bug filing template to provide quick guidance on how to file a descriptive bug and help facilitate action on the bug. This file can be found and updated at [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report-a-bug.md](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report-a-bug.md)

## Request a Feature Template

We also have a feature request template for the same purpose of providing quick guidance and structure on how to file a feature request with necessary information for us to take action on it. This file can be found and updated at [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-a-feature.md](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-a-feature.md)
