# Jest Unit Tests

## What is jest?

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a JavaScript testing framework that we use in this repo to run our unit tests.

- Jest CLI: <https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html>
  - this is where you learn about what all you can put on the command line to run tests
- Jest options and configuration: <https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration>
  - this is where you learn about all the things in `jest.config.js`
