/**
 * `@azure/communication-react` is an npm package that exports the functionality of the Azure Communication Services - UI Library.
 *
 * This package makes it easy for you to build modern communications user experiences using Azure Communication Services. It gives you a library of production-ready UI components that you can drop into your applications:
 *   - Composites: These components are turn-key solutions that implement common communication scenarios. You can quickly add video calling or chat experiences to your applications. Composites are open-source higher order components built using UI components.
 *   - UI Components - These components are open-source building blocks that let you build custom communications experience. Components are offered for both calling and chat capabilities that can be combined to build experiences.
 *
 * These UI client libraries all use Microsoft's Fluent design language and assets. Fluent UI provides a foundational layer for the UI Library and is actively used across Microsoft products.
 *
 * In conjunction with the UI components, the UI Library exposes a stateful client library for calling and chat. This client is agnostic to any specific state management framework and can be integrated with common state managers like Redux or React Context.
 * This stateful client library can be used with the UI Components to pass props and methods for the UI Components to render data. For more information, see Stateful Client Overview.
