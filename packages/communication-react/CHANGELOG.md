### Rooms - Public Preview
Azure Communication Services now supports Rooms in public preview. You can use our CallComposite experience for your users to interact with your Rooms-based calls. Rooms allows our customers to create calls with specific users and the ability to
modify their users' calling experience with a variety of role based access control.

You can read more about [rooms concept here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/rooms/room-concept).

You can apply a Rooms locator in the adapter similar to how you
can join a group call using a locator in the adapter + composite.

`roomId = 99466313975086563 // example roomId`

`locator: { 'roomId': roomId }`

Checkout our [storybook](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library) to read more about what the UI Library offers into your Rooms experience.

### PSTN and 1:N Calling - Public Preview
ACS UI Library Call and CallWithChat composites are introducing two new capabilities (beta):
1. PSTN Outbound Calling
2. ACS 1:N Outbound Calling

Users will now be able to:
- Call a phone number through the existing Call and CallWithChat composites
- Call a phone number and add it to an ongoing call
- Put the call on hold during a phone or ACS call
- Send DTMF tones during a 1:1 phone call

Read more about [getting a phone number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) through Azure Communication Services.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/azure/communication-ui-library/tree/1.2.0)

[Changes since 1.1.0](https://github.com/azure/communication-ui-library/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0)

This stable release introduces `CallWithChatComposite`, a new out of the box experience that combines calling and chat capabilities.
The new composite provides customization API similar to `CallComposite` and `ChatComposite`. You can add custom themes, provide custom avatars and intercept communication with the Azure Communication Services using APIs you are already familiar with from he earlier composites. In addition, `CallWithChatComposite` has a mobile-optimized UX you can enable with the `mobileView` flag.

In addition to the new composite, this stable release includes various style and accessibility improvements to existing UI components. A changelog since the last public beta follows:

## [v1.0.0 - Release](https://github.com/azure/communication-ui-library/tree/1.0.0)

Mon, 06 Dec 2021 19:41:54 GMT

We have heard from developers that building UI is a challenge. The Azure Communication Services UI Library is here to help. It offers modern calling/chat UI features which integrate seamlessly into your application. We designed this library with attention to customizability, localization, and a11y features so that you can create immersive and inclusive experiences your users love. ❤

### Composites

Composites are a low code, end-to-end solution to power your call and chat scenarios with Azure Communication Services. We designed them as an out-of-the box solution to be dropped into your application with the ability to integrate seamlessly with theming, styling and custom application logic.

In the future, we will continue to evolve the composites with the latest Azure Communication Services features so you can integrate them into your application with minimal effort.

Features:
- 🎁 Embed composites into your web applications with a few lines of code
- 🌈 Theme using [FluentUI style theming](https://fluentuipr.z22.web.core.windows.net/heads/master/theming-designer/index.html)
- 🎧 Listen to communication events (e.g when the call has ended)
- 💥 Take action on behalf of the user

### UI Components

We have also added a development experience for developers that want more control over the end-user experience. By exposing our UI components and underlying state management architecture, we seek to empower developers who want granular control over how the UI components build up into the overall communication experience. Compared to composites, the UI components offer increased flexibility at the cost of additional development effort.

Along with the choice to build an open-source library, the UI components allow us to share the tools we use to make great products with you. We hope you will be excited by the level of granularity, use it in your own applications, and consider contributing back.

Features:
- ✏️ Create calling and chat clients using ReactJS
- 🎨 Style UI components using [FluentUI styling patterns](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Component-Styling)
- 🏠 Layout your calling and chat components
- 🎛️ Integrate your own custom logic

### Storybook

📕 Check out our documentation in [storybook](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/) to learn more about the UI Library.
