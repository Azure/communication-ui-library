# UI Library Use Cases

UI Library supports many use cases across calling and chat experiences.
These capabilities are available through UI Components and Composites.
For Composites, these capabilities are built directly in and exposed when the composite is integrated into an application.
For UI Components, these capabilities are exposed through a combination of UI functionality and underlying stateful libraries.
To take full advantage of these capabilities, we recommend using the UI Components with the stateful call and chat client libraries.

## Teams Interoperability

For [Teams Interop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/teams-interop) scenarios, developers can use UI Library Components to join Teams meetings through Azure Communication Services.
To enable Teams Interop, developers can either use calling and chat composites directly or use UI Components to build a custom experience.
When enabling applications with both calling and chat, its important to remember that the chat client can't be initialized until the participant has been admitted to the call.
Once admitted, the chat client can be initialized to join the meeting chat thread.
See the diagram below for guidance:

![Teams Interop pattern for calling and chat](images/teams-interop-pattern.png)

When using UI Components to deliver Teams Interop experiences, UI Library provides examples for key pieces of the experience.
For example:

- [Lobby Example](./?path=/docs/concepts-teams-interop-lobby--docs): Sample lobby for participant to wait to be admitted to the call.
- [Compliance banner](./?path=/docs/concepts-teams-interop-compliance-banner--docs): Sample banner to show the user whether the call is being recorded or not.
- [Teams Theme](./?path=/docs/examples-themes-teams--docs): Sample theme that makes the UI Library looks like Microsoft Teams.

<SingleLineBetaBanner content="The following features are currently in public preview" />

- [File Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/tutorials/file-sharing-tutorial-interop-chat): Feature allows Teams users to share file attachments as part of chat messages.
- [Inline Images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/tutorials/inline-image-tutorial-interop-chat): Feature allows Teams users to attach images as part of chat messages.

## Customization

UI Library exposes patterns for developers to modify components to fit the look and feel of their application.
These capabilities are a key area of differentiation between Composites and UI Components, where Composites provide less customization options in favor of a simpler integration experience.

| Use Case                                            | Composites | UI Components |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Fluent based Theming                                | ✔         | ✔            |
| Experience layout is composable                     |            | ✔            |
| CSS Styling can be used to modify style properties  |            | ✔            |
| Participant gallery layout can be modified          |            | ✔            |
| Icons can be replaced                               | ✔         | ✔            |
| Call control layout can be modified                 | ✔         | ✔            |
| Data models can be injected to modify user metadata | ✔         | ✔            |

## Observability

As part of the decoupled state management architecture of the UI Library, developers are able to access the stateful calling and chat clients directly.
Developers can hook into the stateful client to read the state, handle events and override behavior to pass onto the UI Components.
