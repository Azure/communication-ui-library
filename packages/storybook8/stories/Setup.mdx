# Setting up your app to use Azure Communications UI Library

## Prerequisites

Before you get started make sure you have all the following prerequisites set up and ready to go.

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 18.0.0 and above).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp).
- An identity with both VoIP and Chat scopes. Generate an identity using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).

## Setting Up

UI Library requires a React environment to be setup. Next we will do that.

### Set Up React App with Communication-react template

We'll use our provided `communication-react` create-react-app template for our application. For more information on create-react-app, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
This will create a react application that is compatible with the AzureCommunications UI library.

```bash

npx create-react-app your-ui-lib-application --template communication-react

cd your-ui-lib-application

```

#### npm install

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Library for JavaScript.

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-react
```

`@azure/communication-react` specifies core AzureCommunication Services as `peerDependencies` so that you
can most consistently user the API from the core libraries in your application. You need to install those libraries as well:

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-calling
npm install @azure/communication-chat
```

To try out our [composite adapters](./?path=/docs/composites-get-started--docs) snippets you will need to install `uuid`

```bash
npm install uuid
npm install @types/uuid
```

### Working with our beta features

If you are looking to experiment with our latest beta features, ensure to install the latest beta version for `@azure/communication-react` and corresponding beta dependencies for `@azure/communication-calling` and `@azure/communication-chat`.

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-react@next
```

### Run Create React App

Finally, you can now run the app using the command below:

```bash
npm run start
```

To start your application in development mode.
