# VideoGallery

VideoGallery lays out the local user and each remote participant in a call in a [VideoTile](./?path=/docs/components-video-tile--docs) component. The VideoGallery component is made up of a [Grid Layout](./?path=/docs/components-grid-layout--docs#grid-layout), [Overflow Gallery](./?path=/docs/components-grid-layout--docs#grid-layout), and a [Local Video Tile](./?path=/docs/components-video-gallery--docs#local-video-camera-button). The logic used to place each [VideoTile](./?path=/docs/components-video-tile--docs) component into which section is explained below.

## Importing

```ts
import { VideoGallery } from '@azure/communication-react';
```

## Layouts

This feature allows users to choose from a variety of video gallery layouts. On desktop web, the layouts enabled include default Gallery, Gallery on Top, Focus Mode, and Speaker Mode. On mobile web, the default gallery and large gallery are enabled. This feature will greatly enhance the user experience and provide more flexibility in how users view and interact with video content. Enabling this feature will enable greater productivity and allow for a better flow of discussions and conversations within calls. Here are some example scenarios where custom layouts are useful:

- During a meeting with many participants such as a conference call, the large gallery layout can be selected to have greater visibility of the users in a call.
- During a patient/doctor call in which the patient wants to show something, the doctor could enable focus mode to hide all other video tiles and focus on the speakers video stream.
- In a call with multiple important people that are talking, the speaker mode can be selected which will switch the focus between each speaker as they talk.

### Gallery Layout

If there are no remote video streams on, all participants are placed in the [Grid Layout](./?path=/docs/components-grid-layout--docs) including the local user. Otherwise, only remote participants with their video streams on are placed in the Grid Layout up to a max of `maxRemoteVideoStreams`. The remaining participants are placed in the Horizontal Gallery.

<Canvas of={VideoGalleryStories.DefaultVideoGalleryExampleDocsOnly} source={{ code: DefaultVideoGalleryExampleText }} />

Note: The `maxRemoteVideoStreams` prop limits the number of remote video streams in the [GridLayout](./?path=/docs/components-grid-layout--docs). If the number of remote participants with their video stream on exceeds `maxRemoteVideoStreams` then remote participants in the `dominantSpeakers` prop will be prioritized. Furthermore, the VideoGallery is designed to limit the re-ordering when the `dominantSpeakers` prop is changed.

### Floating Local Video Layout

By default, the local video tile is placed in the Grid Layout. But the local video tile can be placed in a floating and draggable video tile in the bottom right corner by setting the `layout` prop to `'floatingLocalVideo'`.

<Canvas of={VideoGalleryStories.FloatingLocalVideoLayoutDocsOnly} source={{ code: FloatingLocalVideoExampleText }} />

### Speaker layout

Speaker Layout is meant to highlight the current dominant speaker in the call. For this view in the video gallery the only participant that is in the grid view is the participant talking. All other participants are in the overflow gallery. When screen sharing the screenshare will replace this participant and the overflow gallery will behave like normal.

<Canvas of={VideoGalleryStories.SpeakerLayoutExampleDocsOnly} source={{ code: speakerLayoutExampleText }} />

### Focused Content Layout

This layout is meant to highlight the current screenshare stream. In this view when the screenshare is present the other participants will be removed from the grid view and the overflow gallery will be hidden from view. This allows for the focus of the local participant to be only on the screenshare stream.

<Canvas of={VideoGalleryStories.FocusedContentExampleDocsOnly} source={{ code: focusedContentExampleText }} />

## Overflow Gallery

In the VideoGallery, when there are participants who are not to be prioritized in the grid view, the VideoGallery will enter a new layout called Overflow Layout. When in this mode, the VideoGallery will create a sub-gallery that can be placed on the bottom of the VideoGallery displaying participants horizontally by assigning the `overflowGalleryPosition` to `'horizontalBottom'`. This is the default. Conversely, this sub-gallery can be placed on the right displaying participants vertically by assigning the `overflowGalleryPosition` to `'verticalRight'`.

### Horizontal Gallery

The remote participants not in the Grid Layout are placed in a sub-gallery called the Horizontal Gallery in the lower section. A gif element is used to simulate a remote video stream to move the other remote participants to the Horizontal Gallery in the example below. This is the default behavior for the VideoGallery, but can also be used by setting the `overflowGalleryPosition` property to `'horizontalBottom'`.

<Canvas
  of={VideoGalleryStories.WithHorizontalGalleryExampleDocsOnly}
  source={{ code: WithHorizontalGalleryExampleText }}
/>

### Vertical Gallery

The remote participants not in the Grid Layout are placed in a sub-gallery called the Vertical Gallery on the right side. A gif element is used to simulate a remote video stream to move the other remote participants to the Vertical Gallery in the example below. This is used by setting the `overflowGalleryPosition` property to `'verticalRight'`.

<Canvas of={VideoGalleryStories.WithVerticalGalleryExampleDocsOnly} source={{ code: WithVerticalGalleryExampleText }} />

### Best Practices

The Overflow Layout is used best in different ways depending on the applications environment. The goal of The Overflow Layout is to help manage the vertical space of the applications VideoGallery. If your application runs in a window or container that has a narrow aspect ratio, horizontal gallery will be useful for maintaining the best aspect ratio of your video tiles in the grid view.

    <>
      <br />

      <br />
    </>
  </Stack>
</Stack>

The vertical gallery can be most useful when the application is running a very wide environment. Like for example a mobile device in landscape. The wide aspect ratio of the device is useful for when a participant is watching a screen share on a phone so in this situation the Vertical Gallery can help the stream be more visible.

## Content Sharing Experience

Our VideoGallery component is designed for optimal content sharing, incorporating both screen sharing and PowerPoint Live functionalities. The screen shared is the sole element placed in the [Grid Layout](./?path=/docs/ui-components-gridlayout--grid-layout), with all remote participants positioned in the horizontal gallery at the lower section. For effective screen sharing or PowerPoint Live, ensure the sharing participant has their `isScreenSharingOn` prop set to true, along with a defined `screenShareStream` prop (refer to `localParticipant` and `remoteParticipants` props).

### Supported Features

Currently, the VideoGallery component supports two primary features to enhance collaboration and presentation quality: screen sharing and PowerPoint Live.

- <strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Share your local screen with participants in real-time or view remote screen shares.
  For more details, see the sections below.
- <strong>PowerPoint Live:</strong> Exclusively view remote PowerPoint presentations.
  <Link href="?path=/docs/ppt-live--page">Learn more about PowerPoint Live</Link>.

### From a presenter point of view

<Canvas
  source={{ code: ScreenSharingFromPresenterExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.ScreenSharingFromPresenterExampleDocsOnly}
/>

### From a viewer point of view

We have the capability to configure the `screenShareStream` to utilize any `HTMLElement` as the renderElement,
enabling functionalities like screen sharing and PowerPoint Live. It's important to note that, in this specific
example, we're replacing the screenshare video stream with an image merely to simulate the experience.

## Custom Avatar

Rendering of avatars can be customized through the VideoGallery callback `onRenderAvatar`.

<Canvas
  source={{ code: CustomAvatarVideoGalleryExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.CustomAvatarVideoGalleryExampleDocsOnly}
/>

## Custom Style

Style of the VideoGallery container can be customized through its `styles` prop. The `styles` prop is a `VideoGalleryStyles` type with subproperties for each part of the VideoGallery as shown in the example below.

<Canvas
  source={{ code: CustomStyleVideoGalleryExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.CustomStyleVideoGalleryExampleDocsOnly}
/>

## Local Video Camera Button

The VideoGallery can take in customization to allow for the introduction of local camera controls where the button will cycle through the different camera's in the users device. Typical usage is to enable this button on mobile devices. This button is enabled through the use of the `showCameraSwitcherInLocalPreview` prop.

<StorybookBanner palette={yellowBannerPalette}>
  <Text style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}>
    This feature when enabled will disable the ability to drag the local video tile around the video gallery.
  </Text>
</StorybookBanner>

<Canvas
  source={{ code: LocalVideoCameraCycleButtonExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.LocalCameraSwitcherExampleDocsOnly}
/>

## Remote video tile contextual menu

The VideoGallery provides a contextual menu for each remote video tile which can be accessed by hovering the remote video tile and clicking menu button next to the participant display name. You can try it out in any of the above VideoGallery components on this Docs page. The pin/unpin menu item will be available by default to allow pinning participants. To learn more about pinning participants go to the Pinning Participants section below. Menu items to change remote video stream rendering options are also available when the `useProps` hook is used to provide the props to VideoGallery.

### Disabling remote video tile contextual menu

Remote video tile contextual menu is be enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the `remoteVideoTileMenuOptions` prop to false like in the example below.

<Canvas
  source={{ code: PinnedParticipantsDisabledExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.PinnedParticipantsDisabledExampleDocsOnly}
/>

## Pinning Participants

The contextual menu will have a menu item to pin a participant's video tile such that only pinned participants are shown in the GridLayout. This is shown in the video clip below. Pinned participants will be shown in the order that they are pinned.

<Image style={{ width: '90%' }} src="images/video-gallery-pinning.gif" alt="VideoGallery pinning" />

When screensharing is active, pinned participants are placed first in the horizontal gallery as shown in video clip below.

![VideoGallery pinning with screenshare active](images/video-gallery-pinning-with-screenshare.gif)

Pinned participants can be unpinned through the contextual menu as shown in the video clip below.

![VideoGallery unpinning](images/video-gallery-unpinning.gif)

The maximum pinned participants is currently set to 4 for the VideoGallery. The pin menu item will be disabled
when this limit is reached as shown in the screenshot below.

![Disabled pin menu item in VideoGallery when limit reached](images/pinned-limit-reached-video-gallery.png)

### Pinning participants via long touch for mobile

The VideoGallery also caters to pinning participants on mobile by setting the prop `remoteVideoTileMenuOptions` to object \{ kind: 'drawer' \}. This changes the contextual menu to a drawer menu that is opened via long touch. The result is demonstrated in the example below where all mouse clicks are converted to touch to simulate a mobile browser. You can simulate a long touch by long clicking a remote video tile below to see that a drawer menu will appear.

<Canvas
  source={{ code: PinnedParticipantsMobileExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.PinnedParticipantsMobileExampleDocsOnly}
/>

### Managing the pinned participants state

The state of which remote participants are pinned can be managed by defining the value of the `pinnedParticipants` prop. But the callback props `onPinParticipant` and `onUnpinParticipant` must be defined to update the managed state. In the example below, the pinned participants state is managed outside of the VideoGallery component using a `useState` hook . The display names of the pinned participants are shown in text above the VideoGallery.

<Canvas
  source={{ code: ManagedPinnedParticipantsExampleText }}
  of={VideoGalleryStories.ManagedPinnedParticipantsExampleDocsOnly}
/>

## Remote video stream rendering options

When `useProps` hook is used to provide the props to VideoGallery from the [stateful client](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-overview--docs), prop `remoteParticipants` will contain information on the video streams of each remote participant and props `onCreateRemoteStreamView` and `onDisposeRemoteStreamView` handle the creation and disposal of these video streams. The VideoGallery component will have a menu item in the contextual menu of remote video tiles to change the rendering option of active remote video streams to either fill-frame or fit-to-frame. Below are screenshots to demonstrate this feature.

<Stack horizontal={true} tokens={{ childrenGap: '0.5rem' }}>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <Image
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      src="images/fill-frame-video-gallery.png"
      alt="Fill frame in VideoGallery"
    />
    <>Remote video stream rendered to fill frame</>
  </Stack>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <Image
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      src="images/fit-to-frame-menu-item-video-gallery.png"
      alt="Fit to frame menu item in VideoGallery"
    />
    <>Option to change rendering to fit-to-frame</>
  </Stack>
</Stack>
<Stack horizontal={true} tokens={{ childrenGap: '0.5rem' }}>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <Image
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      src="images/fit-to-frame-video-gallery.png"
      alt="Fill to frame in VideoGallery"
    />
    <>Remote video stream rendered to fit-to-frame</>
  </Stack>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <Image
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      src="images/fill-frame-menu-item-video-gallery.png"
      alt="Fill frame menu item in VideoGallery"
    />
    <>Option to change rendering to fill frame</>
  </Stack>
</Stack>

### Assigning the default rendering options

The default rendering options can be set for remote video streams as well as the local video stream through VideoGallery props `remoteVideoViewOptions` and `localVideoViewOptions`. To set the remote video streams to fill frame set the scalingMode to 'Crop' like in the code snippet. To set it to fit-to-frame set scalingMode to 'Fit'.

```typescript
import { VideoGallery, VideoStreamOptions } from '@internal/react-components';

const ViewOptionsDefault = (): JSX.Element => {
  const localVideoViewOptions = {
    scalingMode: 'Crop',
    isMirrored: true
  } as VideoStreamOptions;

  const remoteVideoViewOptions = {
    scalingMode: 'Crop',
    isMirrored: true
  } as VideoStreamOptions;

  return (
    <VideoGallery
      layout="floatingLocalVideo"
      localParticipant={MockLocalParticipant}
      remoteParticipants={MockRemoteParticipants}
      localVideoViewOptions={localVideoViewOptions}
      remoteVideoViewOptions={remoteVideoViewOptions}
    />
  );
};
```

## Local video tile aspect ratio options

The local video tile can have its aspect ratio controlled to ensure the expected behavior for the device formfactor and orientation. If left unset it will follow the default of `followDeviceOrientation` which will have the tile follow the responsive behaviors that the gallery laredy provides.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '1rem' }}>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
      src="images/storybook-gallery-169.png"
      alt="Grid layout for composite video gallery"
    />
    <>Local tile size `16:9` aspect ratio.</>
  </Stack>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
      src="images/storybook-gallery-916.png"
      alt="Floating layout for composite video gallery"
    />
    <>Local tile size `9:16` aspect ratio.</>
  </Stack>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
      src="images/storybook-gallery-hidden.png"
      alt="Floating layout for composite video gallery"
    />
    <>Local tile size `hidden` removes the local tile</>
  </Stack>
</Stack>

## Optimal Video Count and 3x3 Video Tiles

The Optimal Video Count (OVC) feature provides a way to make sure that the number of videos rendered within the gallery is appropiate and that all videos are rendering in the best quality possible. This feature is used in the implementation of the VideoGallery as a default behavior for maxRemoteVideoRenderers property currently exposed, changing the previous default which was static to a dynamic one that it is coming from SDK layer. This Optimal Video Count value could increase or decrease during the call according to the network conditions in conjuction with the memory usage by the participant currently rendering videos. To read more about OVC, video quality and how it works within the sdk, [Click Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-video?pivots=platform-web).

### 3x3 Video Gallery Layout

The 3x3 video gallery allows customers to have 9 remote videos rendering with the highest optimal quality.
