# Dialpad

## Dialpad modes

The Dialpad component is versatile in its usage. Like on a physical phone, the dialpad can have many different
roles. Our Dialpad component is designed to accommodate different scenarios encountered in calling experiences.

### Dialer Mode

This is the default mode of the Dialpad component. In this mode you are able to enter and edit numbers in the
Dialpad's input box. The typical scenario to use this mode is when you are dialling a phone number to call the
number, or to dial in a new participant into an ongoing call.

### DTMF Mode

This mode is for sending DTMF tones when in a call. These tones are used for controlling bots or other services
that you might encounter. Each tone is mapped to a sound that is played when pressing each key. You can disable
these sounds by using the `disableDtmfPlayback` property on the component. In this mode, the input box in the
dialpad is hidden since you are not able to edit DTMF tones that are sent.

Component to render a Dialpad. This component allows numbers and +, \*, # input by clicking on dialpad or using
keyboard

### Customizing your Dialpad

We provide many different ways to customize the Dialpad component. This example showcases how to customize the
format for dialpad input using onChange, how to grab textfield values using onChange, and how to add extra
functionality to dialpad buttons. This overrides the included number formatting behavior to North American phone
numbers. In this example, the sounds are also disabled.
