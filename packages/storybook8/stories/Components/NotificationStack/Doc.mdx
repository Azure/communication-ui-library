# Notification Stack

A wrapper on the `Notification` component with additional features for surfacing Azure Communication Services notifications on the UI consistently.

## Importing

```ts
import { NotificationStack } from '@azure/communication-react';
```

## Example

<Canvas
  of={NotificationStackStories.NotificationStackExampleDocsOnly}
  source={{ code: NotificationStackExampleText }}
/>

## Localization

Similar to other UI components in this library, `NotificationStackProps` accepts all strings shown on the UI as a `strings` field. The `activeNotifications` field selects from these strings to show in the `NotificationStack` UI.

## Dismissed messages

User can dismiss the notifications shown by clicking on the X icon. If you wish to dismiss the notifications automatically, simply set the `autoDismiss` field to true for that specific notification.

## Tracking dismissed messages

The `NotificationStack` component internally tracks dismissed notifications and only shows a `Notification` for
notifications that have not been dismissed. When `activeNotifications` include a timestamp, notifications that
occur after the latest dismissal are shown on the UI. When `activeNotifications` do not include a timestamp, a
dismissed notification is only shown on the UI if it is removed from the active notifications and if it occurs
again.

## Multiple Notification Stack

More than one notification can occur at the same time. The `NotificationStack` component can show multiple
active notifications. To avoid confusing the user, it is important to be mindful to limit the total number of
notifications that are shown together by setting the `maxNotificationsToShow` field.

<ArgTypes of={NotificationStack} />
