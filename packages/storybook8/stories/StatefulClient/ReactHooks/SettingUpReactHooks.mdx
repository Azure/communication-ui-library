# Hooks

[React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) allows developers to use state and other react features without writing a class component.

While you can choose any state management library such as Redux, we also provide a simple way to power react components with our Stateful SDK.
We provide two [custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) in our library, [usePropsFor()](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-react-hooks-usepropsfor--docs) and [useSelector()](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-react-hooks-useselector--docs), that allow you to subscribe to changes in the SDK state and bind to our UI components.
After binding with the custom hooks a SDK state change will trigger a re-render of the UI component, and events on the component will call into the SDK clients.

## Before you Start

Before you start, you need to wrap your whole App with Providers.
They give you access to global variables (like Stateful ChatClient/CallClient) for our hooks to consume.
There are different Providers for building apps with varying functionality:

### Chat

For your Chat app, use the `ChatClientProvider` and `ChatThreadClientProvider` to give hooks access to the `ChatClient` and `ChatThreadClient`.
`statefulChatClient` and `chatThreadClient` instances need to be passed to the Provider when you wrap your app.
For more information on creating them, see [Overview](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-overview--docs)

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <ChatClientProvider chatClient={statefulChatClient}>
    <ChatThreadClientProvider chatThreadClient={ChatThreadClient}>
      <App />
    </ChatThreadClientProvider>
  </ChatClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Calling

For your Calling app, use the `CallClientProvider`, `CallAgentProvider` and `CallProvider` to give hooks access to the `CallClient`, `CallAgentClient` and `Call`.
`statefulCallClient`, `callAgent` and `call` instances need to be passed to the Provider when you wrap your app.
For more information on creating them, see [Overview](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-overview--docs)

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <CallClientProvider callClient={statefulCallClient}>
    <CallAgentProvider callAgent={callAgent}>
      <CallProvider call={call}>
        <App />
      </CallProvider>
    </CallAgentProvider>
  </CallClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Next

Once you have wrapped your entire app with providers, you are now can use the usePropsFor() method inside of your app to connect your components to the state.

To see full end-to-end examples using providers, see [Getting Started with Call Stateful Client](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-get-started-call--docs) and [Getting Started with Chat Stateful Client](./?path=/docs/stateful-client-get-started-chat--docs).
