# Local Preview

## Basic Example

To build a local preview, we recommend using the Fluent UI
[Stack](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/stack) as a container as shown in the code below.
For enabling and disabling the camera or microphone we suggest using the
[Toggle](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/toggle) component. The area for showing your
local preview is a [VideoTile](./?path=/docs/ui-components-videotile--video-tile) which can also be used in our
video grid layouts.

Note: In the code example, all `%` characters were replaced by their unicode value `\u0025` due to URI malformed
issue when loading the storybook snippets

<Canvas of={LocalPreviewStories.LocalPreview} source={{ code: localPreviewExampleText }} />
