# Device Setting

## Create a dropdown of cameras to select

To build a UI component for device settings, we recommend using the Fluent UI
[Dropdown](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/dropdown). Using the retrieved devices from
the calling sdk, apply the devices as options in the dropdown. When a user selects an element from the dropdown,
use the `onChange` callback to save the result. For this case we are just going to use an array of placeholder
cameras (strings) and we are going to demonstrate how to use a FluentUI `Dropdown` to create a list of devices
for a user to select.
