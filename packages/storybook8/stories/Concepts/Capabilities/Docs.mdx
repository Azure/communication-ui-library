# Capabilities

Capabilities are actions that ACS users can perform during a call which are defined based on their role. Capabilites are only
present in certain types of calls like the Teams interop scenario.

The capabilities of an ACS user are reflected in the Call and CallWithChat composites by disabling controls and notifications.
For example, if the ACS user loses the capability to turn their video on and share their screen then this will be reflected in
the Call composite like shown in the screenshot below.

Currently, the only capabilities that are reflected in the Teams interop scenario are:

- unmuting microphone
- turning on video
- sharing screen

For the Teams interop scenario, user roles and capabilities can be configured in Teams by the meeting organizer through
'Meeting options' like the screenshot below.

A Rooms call also has roles for ACS users which define their capabilities. The Rooms call feature is supported in beta
version **1.3.2-beta.1** or later. [Learn more about Rooms calls and the different roles within](./?path=/docs/concepts-rooms--docs).

## Teams policies

Teams policies can be assigned to Teams users which include defining the capabilities of the assigned Teams users within
a tenant. To learn more about Teams policies click
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/assign-policies-users-and-groups). It is important to note that
Teams policies cannot be applied to ACS users so their capabilities are not affected by Teams policies.

Teams policies do, however, affect Teams users who use ACS to join a Teams meeting which is also known as
'Communication as Teams user'. 'Communication as Teams user' is supported in beta version **1.5.1-beta.1** or later. For
more on using 'Communication as Teams user', click [here](./?path=/docs/concepts-communication-as-teams-user--docs). Currently, the only
capability affected by Teams policies for 'Communication as Teams user' in Teams meetings is share screen.

## Listening to changes in capabilities

The CallAdapter and CallWithChatAdapter allow you to listen to 'capabilitiesChanged' events by defining your own
`CapabilitiesChangedListener` callback. The following code snippet shows an example of the CallAdapter using a
`CapabilitiesChangedListener` to simply log the capabilities changed information to the browser console.

It is important to note that using the `CapabilitiesChangedListener` callback will not override the behavior of
enabling/disabling of corresponding controls and showing notifications in the Call and CallWithChat composites.
