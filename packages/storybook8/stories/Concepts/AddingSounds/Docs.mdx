# Adding Sounds to your Communication Experiences

The web is a quiet place and communication experiences are not. This concept is about creating a more rich communication experience by providing event driven sounds to your communication experiences.

## Calling sounds

This feature is designed to empower developers by enabling them to integrate sounds into their calling experiences.
While the web environment is generally quiet, calling experiences tend to be more dynamic. There are various scenarios in which we aim to incorporate sound
cues throughout the call's lifecycle to offer users real-time feedback about ongoing events. These include:

<ul>
  <li>Call Ringing - Call is outgoing to the callee</li>
  <li>Call Ended - Call ends because you or the callee ended the call</li>
  <li>Call Busy - Call is rejected by the callee because they are busy and unable to take the call</li>
</ul>

It is important to note that as the developer you will need to ensure that your mp3 or other sound files are loaded or bundled appropriately in your project.
Recommended reading for this is found here with these common bundlers:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-images">webpack</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/">create-react-app</a>
  </li>
</ul>

We are providing these sound experiences on our `CallComposite` and `CallWithChatComposite`. These sounds are
applied through the `CallAdapter` options and sounds can be added to the experience with the following snippet.
