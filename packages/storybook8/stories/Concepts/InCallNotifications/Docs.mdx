# In Call Notifications

Azure Communication Services UI Library is adding support for improved notifications

In call notifications are essential for providing users with timely and relevant information about their calling experience.
Whether it is an error message, a mute status, or a network quality indicator, notifications can help users troubleshoot issues and improve their communication.
The new feature of ACS UI Library simplifies the display and management of multiple notifications in a consistent and user-friendly way.
The in-call notification feature introduces a streamlined UI experience for displaying errors and notifications in the calling environment.

## Incorporating In Call Notifications into your Experience

The UI Library enables users to enhance their video conferencing experiences by providing improved notifications by default within the CallComposite and CallWithChat experiences.

There are also two Components that have been exposed for this feature:

[Notification](./?path=/docs/components-notification--doc)

Notification is a container that shows a notification in a bar format with an icon, title, message, and button. The icon and title are necessary while a message and button are optional. See the example below:

[NotificationStack](./?path=/docs/components-notificationstack--doc)

NotificationStack is a wrapper on the Notification component with additional features for surfacing Azure Communication Services notifications on the UI consistently.
