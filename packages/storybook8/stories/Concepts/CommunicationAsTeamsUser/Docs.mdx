## How does UI Library support Communication as Teams user?

The UI Library helps Contoso build custom teams client experiences via a simplified API surface, providing a set of UI components,
and offering UI composites to reduce development time to production. The UI Library is able to offer all of these capabilities by taking
in a Teams access token as input and using teams-specific calling functions for making calls as a Teams user.

Note: The UI Library is not able to create teams access tokens and is not designed to help you configure your AAD application.

You can try out this quickstart to create a Teams access token [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/manage-teams-identity?pivots=programming-language-javascript)

### Why do I need to pass in an identifier when using the UI Library with Azure Communication Services when I don't need to with the underlying SDKs?

In order for us to create a better experience when using the UI Library, we need to know the local user's id so we can provide a better UX for the end user.
We understand it is possible to pull the id from the access token claims however this could change and so we opted to explicitly ask for it.
