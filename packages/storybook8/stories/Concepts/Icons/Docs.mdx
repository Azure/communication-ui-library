# Icons

Icons used in the Composites and the Components primarily come from the Fluent UI `react-icons` library.
Composites and Components have a set of default icons that are used and are displayed below with their names.

A small number of icons that are built into the base components of Fluent are derivied from the [Fluent icons CDN](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons).
To initialize these icons you must call `initializeIcons`. This should be called once in your application.

**All the default icons can be replaced with a custom icon by providing a custom JSX element.**
The method for providing custom icons differs between composites and components. Please read below for more details about each.

Icons that are used to display file attachments in messages come from the Fluent UI `react-file-type-icons` library. To initialize these icons you must call `initializeFileTypeIcons`. This should be called once in your application.

## Composites

To ensure the base set of Fluent CDN icons are initialized, you must call `initializeIcons` before rendering any composites. This should be called once in your application.

```tsx
import { initializeIcons } from '@fluentui/react';
initializeIcons();
```

### Custom Icons

All Composites expose a prop `icons` that allows you to override the default icons used inside Composites.

Here is a sample code showcasing how you can override an icon used inside Composites with custom icons.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`
<CallComposite
  adapter={adapter}
  icons={{
    LocalDeviceSettingsCamera: <p>My Custom Icon</p>
  }}
/>
  `}
/>

### Default Composite Icons

Below is a list of all the default icons you can override in Composites with their names.

<IconGridWithSearch icons={DEFAULT_COMPOSITE_ICONS} />

## Components

Similar to Composites, to ensure the base set of Fluent CDN icons are initialized, you must call `initializeIcons` before rendering any components. This should be called once in your application.

```tsx
import { initializeIcons } from '@fluentui/react';
initializeIcons();
```

Further to the `initializeIcons` call, you will also need to setup the component icons you wish to use using the `registerIcons` method as shown below.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`
import { registerIcons } from '@fluentui/react';
import { DEFAULT_COMPONENT_ICONS } from '@azure/communication-react';
//
// If you don't want to provide custom icons, you can register the default ones included with the library.
// This will ensure that all the icons are rendered correctly.
//
registerIcons({ icons: DEFAULT_COMPONENT_ICONS });
  `}
/>

### Custom Icons

For overriding a default icon, you can provide a custom react element as shown in the example below.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`
import { registerIcons } from '@fluentui/react';
import { DEFAULT_COMPONENT_ICONS } from '@azure/communication-react';
const customIcons = {...DEFAULT_COMPONENT_ICONS, {
  ControlButtonCameraOff: <p>My Custom Icon</p>
}};
registerIcons({ icons: customIcons });
  `}
/>

### Default Component Icons

Below is a list of all the default icons you can override in Components with their names.

<IconGridWithSearch icons={DEFAULT_COMPONENT_ICONS} />

## File types icons

To ensure the set of Fluent file types icons is initialized, you must call `initializeFileTypeIcons` before rendering ChatComposite, CallWithChatComposite or MessageThread component. This should be called once in your application.

```tsx
import { initializeFileTypeIcons } from '@fluentui/react-file-type-icons';
initializeFileTypeIcons();
```
