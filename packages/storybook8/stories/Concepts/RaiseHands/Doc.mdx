# Raise Hands

Azure Communication Services UI Library is adding support for Raised Hands.

With this new feature, users can now raise and lower their hand during a meeting or call. The user can also see the raised hands of other users to know if someone else is looking to speak. Raised hands are displayed prominently in the video gallery but can also be seen on the participant list to be informed of everyone raising their hands on a call. Enabling this feature will enable greater productivity and allow for a better flow of discussions and conversations within calls. Here are some example scenarios where raised hands are useful:

During a meeting with many participants, the raised hands feature can help the host to manage the conversation and ensure that everyone has a chance to speak. Participants can raise their hands to indicate that they would like to speak, and the host can call on them in order.

In a call setting, the raised hands feature can be used to signal that an action has been completed by the members of a call. For example, participants can raise their hands to signal that they have completed reading a document that has been shared. This lets the host know they can move on with the meeting.

## Incorporating Raise Hands into your Experience

The UI Library enables users to enhance their video conferencing experiences by providing the raised hands feature by default within the CallComposite and CallWithChat experiences.
