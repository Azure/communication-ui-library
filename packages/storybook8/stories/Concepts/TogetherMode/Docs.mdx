# TogetherMode

Together Mode in Teams uses AI to place everyone in a shared virtual background, creating the feeling of being in the same room.
It’s built to make meetings more engaging and foster stronger connections.

It’s especially effective for training sessions, workshops, or team-building activities.
A classroom setting, like the one shown below, promotes learning and collaboration, helping participants stay engaged and comfortable in a familiar atmosphere.

## Supported Scenario

Together Mode is available only in Teams meetings and group calls. It can be started exclusively by Teams users with the roles of Organizer, Co-organizer, or Presenter.
ACS (Azure Communication Services) users cannot initiate Together Mode themselves, but they can view the Together Mode stream if it’s started by a Teams user.

The option to start or switch to Together Mode is disabled because ACS users do not have permission to initiate Together
Mode.

When a Teams user starts Together Mode, the view option becomes enabled, allowing ACS users to switch to the Together
Mode view.

## Implementing with the VideoGallery

The VideoGallery component is used to display PowerPoint Live sessions. This multi-functional component also supports video streams and screen sharing. Here’s a brief guide to integrating it:

<Source code={PPTLiveSnippetText} />

This code snippet illustrates the utilization of the `usePropsFor` hook from the `@azure/communication-react` package, which dynamically manages the properties of the `VideoGallery`. This ensures that the component reacts appropriately to changes in state or properties.

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [VideoGallery](./?path=/docs/components-video-gallery--docs). This component facilitates the seamless integration of video streams or shared content into your application.
