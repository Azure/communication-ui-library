# Best Practices

Below are some best practices to follow to ensure your end users get the best experience with your Web App.

## Disposing of Composite Adapters

To ensure resources are cleaned up, and Azure services know that a user intentionally left a call or chat, you should dispose of your Composite Adapters appropriately. This involves disposing of them when the relevant component unmounts, as well as in the `beforeunload` window event:

```ts
// Dispose of the adapter in the window's before unload event.
useEffect(() => {
  const disposeAdapter = (): void => adapter?.dispose();
  window.addEventListener('beforeunload', disposeAdapter);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', disposeAdapter);
}, [adapter]);
```

```ts
// Dispose of adapter when the component unmounts or before the adapter is changed.
// This is not necessary if you are using useAzureCommunication*Adapter to create your adapter as this hook will do this for you.
useEffect(() => {
  return () => adapter?.dispose();
}, [adapter]);
```

## Providing Keyboard Shortcuts

It is recommended to provide keyboard shortcuts for your end users. This improves the accessibility of your Web App. Here is the recommend minimum set of shortcuts to support. Before implementing ensure these do not conflict with any existing keyboard shortcuts in your Web App:

- `ctrl+shift+M`: `Mute/Unmute`
- `ctrl+shift+O`: `Video On/Off`

An example to provide this behavior when using a Call Composite:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const subscribeKeyboardShortcuts = (event): void => {
    const adapterState = adapter?.getState();

    // Handle ctrl + shift key modifiers
    if (event.ctrlKey === true && event.shiftKey === true) {
      switch (event.key) {
        // Toggle mute with ctrl+shift+M
        case 'M': {
          if (!adapterState) break;
          const isUserMuted = adapterState.call
            ? adapterState.call?.isMuted
            : !adapterState.isLocalPreviewMicrophoneEnabled;
          isUserMuted ? adapter?.unmute() : adapter?.mute();
          event.preventDefault();
          break;
        }

        // Toggle video with ctrl+shift+O
        case 'O': {
          if (!adapterState) break;
          const isUserLocalVideoOn = !!(adapterState.call
            ? adapterState.call.localVideoStreams.length
            : adapterState.devices.unparentedViews.length);
          isUserLocalVideoOn ? adapter?.stopCamera() : adapter?.startCamera();
          event.preventDefault();
          break;
        }

        default:
          break;
      }
    }
  };

  document.addEventListener('keydown', subscribeKeyboardShortcuts);
  return () => document.addEventListener('keydown', subscribeKeyboardShortcuts);
}, [adapter]);
```

## Do not permit more than one Call to be active at a time on mobile browsers

Your application should not connect to calls from multiple browser tabs simultaneously as this can cause undefined behavior due to resource allocation for microphone and camera on the device. Developers are encouraged to always hang up calls when completed in the background before starting a new one.

An example to enforce this behavior using the [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) API:

```tsx
const [isSecondaryInstance, setIsSecondaryInstance] = useState(false);

// Only allow one instance of the sample to be open at a time on mobile
useEffect(() => {
  const channel = new BroadcastChannel('secondary-instance-check');
  let isOriginalInstance = true;

  channel.postMessage('new-instance-opened');

  // Listen for messages from the other instances. When a message is received, if this is original instance
  // it will send a message back to the other instances to inform them an instance is already open.
  channel.addEventListener('message', (msg) => {
    if (msg.data === 'new-instance-opened' && isOriginalInstance) {
      // Received a message from a secondary instance, respond to all new instances the app is already running in this tab
      channel.postMessage('instance-already-open');
    }
    if (msg.data === 'instance-already-open') {
      // Received a message from the original instance informing this App it is a secondary instance.
      isOriginalInstance = false;
      setIsSecondaryInstance(true);
    }
  });
}, []);
```
