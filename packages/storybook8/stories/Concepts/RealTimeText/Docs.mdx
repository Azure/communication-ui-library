# Real-Time Text

## Overview

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

Real-Time Text (RTT) is a feature that allows text to be sent and received instantly during voice and video calls. As you type, the text appears immediately, letter by letter, making the conversation feel more natural and dynamic, just like talking.

For example, if an RTT user types "Hello, how are you?" during a call, the recipient sees each character as it is typed: "H," then "He," then "Hel," and so on. This immediacy allows for fluid, continuous exchanges, benefiting users with hearing or speech impairments and improving clarity in noisy or quiet environments.

## Key Scenarios Where RTT is Useful:

Accessibility: RTT empowers individuals with speech or hearing impairments to participate in conversations actively, ensuring their input is received as naturally as spoken words.

Enhancing Clarity: In noisy environments or situations with audio quality issues, RTT provides a reliable text-based alternative.

## Why RTT Matters

Microsoft is dedicated to accessibility, and the incorporation of Real-Time Text (RTT) supports this commitment by adhering to accessibility standards such as The European Accessibility Act (Directive (EU) 2019/882. This directive requires that voice and video services support RTT by June 2025, ensuring inclusive communication throughout Europe. Voice and video services will not be permitted to operate in Europe or have Europe based customers after June 2025 without RTT, making the inclusion of this feature in the UI Library critically important.

## Incorporating RTT in Your Experience

Real-Time Text is supported by default and are automatically included within the CallComposite and CallWithChatComposite experiences.

Real-Time Text is also supported for component only users.

List of components exported for Real-Time Text:

[RealTimeText](./?path=/docs/components-real-time-text--docs) is a single line of Real-Time Text Message. It will display an 'isTyping' badge when the Real-Time Text message is still ongoing.

[RealTimeTextModal](./?path=/docs/components-real-time-text-modal--docs) is a component showing a disclaimer warning that Real-Time Text is enabled for everyone in the call once turned on. This is important as Real-Time Text can not be turned off once it is started.

[StartRealTimeTextButton](./?path=/docs/components-start-real-time-text-button--docs) is a component that can be used to turn on Real-Time Text. Note that Real-Time Text will not be started for everyone in the call until a message is sent.

[CaptionsBanner](./?path=/docs/components-captions-banner--docs) is a component that combines and displays captions and Real-Time Text in one banner. Developers and use 'usePropsFor' to gather all the information required to power this component, including the list of Real-Time Text and captions messages in the call. User can also use this component for captions only or Real-Time Text only.

## How to use Real-Time Text

Real-Time Text is automatically included within the CallComposite and CallWithChatComposite experiences.

To turn on Real-Time Text, users need to navigate to the control bar after call is connected, and click on more button. Inside the menu pop up, click on Real-Time Text, then click on Turn on RTT for this call.

Note that Real-Time Text will be enabled for all participants in the call once the first message is sent. It cannot be turned off.
