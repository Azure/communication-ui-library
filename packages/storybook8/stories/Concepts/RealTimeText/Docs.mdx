# Real-Time Text

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

Azure Communication Services UI Library supports Real-Time Text. Real-Time Text is a powerful tool that enables developers to enhance the accessibility of their videos.
Real-Time Text (RTT) is a new accessibility feature that enables live transmission of text as it is typed, enhancing communication during voice and video calls. RTT displays text instantly, character by character, creating a natural and dynamic communication experience that mirrors spoken conversation.

Real-Time Text is supported by default and are automatically included within the CallComposite and CallWithChatComposite experiences.

Real-Time Text is also supported for component only users.

List of components exported for Real-Time Text:

[RealTimeText](./?path=/docs/components-real-time-text--docs) is a single line of Real-Time Text Message. It will display an 'isTyping' badge when the Real-Time Text message is still ongoing.

[RealTimeTextModal](./?path=/docs/components-real-time-text-modal--docs) is a component showing a disclaimer warning that Real-Time Text is enabled for everyone in the call once turned on. This is important as Real-Time Text can not be turned off once it is started.

[StartRealTimeTextButton](./?path=/docs/components-start-real-time-text-button--docs) is a component that can be used to turn on Real-Time Text. Note that Real-Time Text will not be started for everyone in the call until a message is sent.

[CaptionsBanner](./?path=/docs/components-captions-banner--docs) is a component that combines and displays captions and Real-Time Text in one banner. Developers and use 'usePropsFor' to gather all the information required to power this component, including the list of Real-Time Text and captions messages in the call. User can also use this component for captions only or Real-Time Text only.
