# PowerPoint Live

Azure Communication Services (ACS) integrate PowerPoint Live into Teams meetings, enhancing the presentation experience. This feature allows real-time engagement with presentations, making it an invaluable tool for various scenarios.

## Overview

Azure Communication Services UI Library is adding support for receiving PowerPoint Live video stream.

PowerPoint Live in Teams gives both the presenter and audience an inclusive and engaging experience, combining the best parts of presenting in PowerPoint with the connection and collaboration of a Microsoft Teams meeting.
ACS UI Library is now able to receive such streams, allowing for better Spresentations and more personalized experiences.
Enabling this feature will enable greater productivity and allow for a better experience for ACS based participants in interop calls.

In the ACS UI library, users participate as attendees to view PowerPoint Live sessions. The interaction capabilities for attendees are set and controlled by the lead presenter of the session.

For a detailed breakdown of the capabilities available to each role during a PowerPoint Live session, please refer to the [PowerPoint Live documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-from-powerpoint-live-in-microsoft-teams-28b20e74-7165-499c-9bd4-0ad975d448ad). For more technical details on how to implement these features using the web calling SDK, consult the [Calling SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features).

Some of the best use cases for PowerPoint Live are:

- Corporate presentations
- Educational lectures
- Remote training sessions
- Webinars

## Incorporating PowerPoint Live into your experience:

The UI Library enables users to enhance their video conferencing experiences by providing the receive PowerPoint live video stream by default within the CallComposite and CallWithChat experiences.

Important notes:

Currently, this feature is only supports receiving a non interactive PowerPoint Live feed. ACS users will not be able to interact with the video stream in the same manner a user on the Teams client will able to, nor will ACS users be able to send a PowerPoint Live feed.

This feature is only available for ACS/Teams Interop calls

## Implementing with the VideoGallery

The VideoGallery component is used to display PowerPoint Live sessions. This multi-functional component also supports video streams and screen sharing. Hereâ€™s a brief guide to integrating it:

<Source code={PPTLiveSnippetText} />

This code snippet illustrates the utilization of the `usePropsFor` hook from the `@azure/communication-react` package, which dynamically manages the properties of the `VideoGallery`. This ensures that the component reacts appropriately to changes in state or properties.

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [VideoGallery](./?path=/docs/components-video-gallery--docs). This component facilitates the seamless integration of video streams or shared content into your application.

## FAQs

### Can I use UI library to share PowerPoint Live?

No, we do view-only for PowerPoint Live right now.

### Can I use PowerPoint Live in a group call?

No, our support is limited to Teams meetings where the presenter can share the PowerPoint directly through the Teams client.

### If I have found any issues or anything missing with the PowerPoint live in the CallComposite where can I go?

Please log a [Github issue](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/issues), and someone from our team can work with you.

## Tips to Investigate cases:

- For pptlive initialization: Web Calling SDK has telemetry with initialize, success, failure.

- ACS takes this first responsibility when the issue is raised.

- Use callId to Locate the Call: Begin the debugging process by identifying the call with issues, using the callId. This ID is your entry point for tracing the problem.

- Examine contentId for Specific Content Issues: Once the call is located, look for the contentId. The contentId is a unique identifier for a sharing session within that call, pinpointing the content that is causing problems.

- Check featureDetails_step for Detailed Insights: Investigate the featureDetails_step to uncover detailed information about the steps taken during the PPTLive session. This can include both the operational steps Contoso performed and any error steps that occurred.
