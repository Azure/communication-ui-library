# Adding Reactions to your Meeting Experiences

The reactions feature in meetings enables participants to provide non-verbal feedback. This concept is about creating a more rich communication experience and helping the host or speaker in a meeting to track engagement and emotions of the audience.

## Meeting Reactions

Meeting reactions are a versatile tool that can enhance communication, engagement, and inclusivity in virtual meetings. They are part of a broader trend towards making communication experiences more expressive and interactive. Meeting reactions in
communication experience has several functions. These functions include:

<ul>
  <li>
    In an ongoing meeting or call - User expressing their support, approval, funny emotion, love, surprise emotion or
    appreciation to an ongoing topic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meeting where admin restricts a particular set of users to talk or turn their video on - send reaction or seeing
    reaction is the only mode of communication in a larger audience to interact with everyone without interrupting
    ongoing presentation.
  </li>
  <li>Allows the meeting host to track engagement of the participants.</li>
  <li>Provides an alternate means of communication for people who have difficulty in responding verbally.</li>
</ul>

It is important to note that as the developer you will need to ensure that your sprite animation image files are loaded or bundled appropriately in your project.

We are providing the meeting reaction experiences on our `CallComposite` and `CallWithChatComposite`. The reaction resources are
