# Breakout Rooms

## Overview

ACS and Team identity users are now ready to be moved into breakout rooms in Teams meetings when the meeting organizer
assigns the ACS or Teams identity user a breakout room and opens that breakout room. ACS and Teams identity users,
however, will not yet have the ability to choose their breakout room when they are granted by meeting organizer. ACS
and Teams identity users can be move into breakout rooms but they will not yet have the ability to create and manage
breakout rooms when they have organizer or co-organizer role.

to learn more about breakout rooms in Teams meetings and how to create and manage breakout rooms as a Teams user.

## Composites

ACS and Team identity users using the CallComposite and CallWithChatComposite will now be able move to breakout rooms
in Teams meetings. When the meeting organizer assigns a breakout room to an ACS or Teams identity user and that
breakout room is opened, the composite will automatically change the current call to the breakout room. When the
breakout room is closed, the ACS or Teams identity user will automatically be moved back the the main meeting.

There are notifications that will be shown to guide the ACS or Teams identity user through the composite transitions
between the main meeting and breakout room. The notifications are shown when:

- the user's assigned breakout room opens and the user will be automatically moved to the breakout room
- the user's assigned breakout room opens and the user is prompted to join
- the user joins a breakout room
- the user's assigned breakout room is changed while already in a breakout room
- the user is in a breakout room with a time limit and that breakout room is closing soon
- the user is in a breakout room and that breakout room is closed

## Handling breakoutRoomsUpdated events

The [CallAdapter](?path=/docs/composites-adapters--docs#calladapter) and CallWithChatAdapter are able to receive
`breakoutRoomsUpdated` events and allows you to handle these events by defining your own `BreakoutRoomsUpdateListener`
callback. The following code snippet shows an example of a `BreakoutRoomsUpdateListener` that outputs the event to the
browser console.

Note: The `breakoutRoomsUpdated` room event encompasses 4 types: `assignedBreakoutRooms`, `join`,
`breakoutRoomsSettings`, and `breakoutRooms`
