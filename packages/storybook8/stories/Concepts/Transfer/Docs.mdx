# Transfer

During an active call, a participant can transfer another participant to another user or call. The transfer process
starts when a participant (the transferor) transfers one participant (the transferee) to another
participant (the transfer target.) The transferee receives a transfer accepted event which contains the new call that was started to facilitate the transfer.
If the oubound call is accepted by the transfer target, the transferee joins the new call. Finally, the call is ended by the transferor when the transferee leaves.

In the current version, ACS users cannot request to transfer other participants yet but they can receive transfers.
Currently, only Teams users can request to transfer other participants. To make a call to a Teams user or Teams Voice app, refer
to the [Ad-hoc calling page](?path=/docs/adhoc-calling--docs).

## Handling transfer events

The [CallAdapter](./?path=/docs/composites-adapters--docs#call-adapter) is able to receive `transferAccepted` events and
allows you to handle these events by defining your own `TransferRequestedListener` callback. The following code snippet
shows an example of a `TransferAcceptedListener` that outputs all transferred calls to state.

## Requesting transfers

ACS users cannot request transfers yet.
