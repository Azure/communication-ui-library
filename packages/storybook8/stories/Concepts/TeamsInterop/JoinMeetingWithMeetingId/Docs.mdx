# Use Teams MeetingId and passcode

The [join existing call](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite--join-existing-call) provides an easy
playground to join an existing Azure Communication Services group call or an existing Teams meeting. This is
useful if you want to explore the composite with multiple users. There are two ways to join an existing call:

## Where to find the Teams MeetingId and passcode:

- Outlook. Open the meeting you want to join. At the bottom of the meeting invitation under Or join by enteringa meeting ID, you'll find the ID and passcode.
- Teams.Open the meeting you want to join. Click on the three dots at the top right of the meeting window and select meeting info.
