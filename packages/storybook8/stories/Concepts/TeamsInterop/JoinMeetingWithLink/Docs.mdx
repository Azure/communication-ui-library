# Joining an existing Call

The [join existing call](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite--join-existing-call) provides an easy
playground to join an existing Azure Communication Services group call or an existing Teams meeting. This is
useful if you want to explore the composite with multiple users. There are two ways to join an existing call:

## Where to find the Teams Link:

- Outlook. Open the meeting you want to join. Find "Join meeting" link.
- Teams. Open the meeting you want to join. Go to partipants tab and click on button share invite and copy
  meeting link.
