# Using the UI Composites in other Frameworks

The Azure Communication Services UI library is written in [React](https://react.dev/). If you are using a different framework,
you can still use the UI Composites by using our Loader functions for each of the composites.

These functions mount each of our React Composites to your applications DOM. The Functions that are available are:

- `loadChatComposite`
- `loadCallComposite`
- `loadCallWithChatComposite`
- `loadOutboundCallComposite`

## How they work

Our JavaScript loaders use [react](https://react.dev/) under the hood. They handle all of the react complexity and allow the composites
to be placed in any application, including applications written with JQuery, Angular, or any Node application using [module imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

They work by taking in a DOM element. They render and attach the React Composite to that element. This means
that you can use the UI Composites in any application that can render HTML elements to the browser DOM.

**Note:** Something to keep in mind when using these loader functions for the UI Composites is that you are taking on
not just the bundle for `@azure/communication-react` but also the bundle for `react` and `react-dom`. Best practice here
is to lazy load these chunks so that you don't get caught waiting for the large bundle when you don't need your
composite experience yet.

This can be done like so:

```ts
...
/**
 * This is how you would load in the CallComposite with lazy loading. This goes in
 * line in whatever function might initiate your call experience.
 */
*/
import('@azure/communication-react/javascript-loaders').then(async (uiLib) => {
  this.adapter = await uiLib
    .loadCallComposite() // <- you can then use the loader functions here.
...
```

## Setup needed before calling the functions

All of the loaders are not included on the main API for the UI library. To better support our other customers using supported
versions of React, we are providing these loaders in a submodule of `@azure/communication-react`. To use these loaders you will import
from a different path than the main UI library.

```ts
import {
  loadChatComposite,
  loadCallComposite,
  loadCallWithChatComposite,
  loadOutboundCallComposite
} from '@azure/communication-react/javascript-loaders';
```

Since these functions are imported from a submodule you might need to make some changes to your
`tsconfig.json` to [handle the **submodule**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#module). To do this you will need to set the following fields as follows

```json
"compilerOptions": {
  "module": "NodeNext",
  "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
}
```

Once you have set these you will be able to import them from the submodule. You do not need to state the
submodule in your `package.json` as the submodule is included when you define you `@azure/communication-react`
dependency.

## Using the Loaders

The following snippet is an example of how you might import the `CallComposite` in your [Angular](https://angular.dev/) application.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-calling',
  standalone: true,
  templateUrl: './calling.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./calling.component.css']
})
export class CallingComponent {
  userId = '<ACS User Id>';
  token = '<ACS Token>';
  displayName = 'User';
  groupId = '<GUID for call>';
  adapter: any;

  /**
   * This is how you would load in the CallComposite with lazy loading. This
   * will only load the CallComposite and the UI library when the function is called.
   */
  async loadCalling(): Promise<void> {
    import('@azure/communication-react/javascript-loaders').then(async (uiLib) => {
      this.adapter = await uiLib
        .loadCallComposite(
          {
            userId: this.userId,
            token: this.token,
            displayName: this.displayName,
            locator: { groupId: this.groupId }
          },
          // this is the DOM element you want to attach the composite to. This will be in your Template for the component.
          document.getElementById('call-composite-container'),
          {
            callControls: {
              displayType: 'compact'
            }
          }
        )
        .then((adapter) => {
          if (adapter) {
            /**
             * Here is where you can subscribe to events from the Adapter after it has been created.
             */
            adapter.on('callEnded', () => {
              console.log('Call ended');
            });
          }
        });
    });
  }

  /**
   * You will want to observe your frameworks Component life cycle and make sure you asking
   * that the adapter is disposed of when the component is destroyed.
   */
  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    if (this.adapter) {
      this.adapter.dispose();
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `loadCallComposite` function to load the `CallComposite` into the DOM. To
do this we are using the window object to get this element. In the example we have given the element the `id`
of `call-composite-container`. This is the element that the `CallComposite` will be attached to.

In order for this to work the return from the DOM element must be defined. if the element is not set then the composite
will not be attached to the DOM.

## FAQ

### Should I use this in my React application?

While you can technically call these functions in your React application, it is not recommended. We recommend to have better
control over the lifecycle of the Composites and how you construct the adapter it is best to use them directly from `@azure/communication-react`.

### How can I use these in a Server side rendered application?

In order to have these functions work, you need to make sure that they are called **only** once there is a reference
to the DOM. If these functions are called before there is a reference to the DOM then the function will throw when React tries to mount
the composite to the DOM.
