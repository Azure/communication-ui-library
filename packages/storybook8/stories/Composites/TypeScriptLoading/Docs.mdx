# Using the UI Composites in other Frameworks

The Azure Communication Services UI library is written in [React]() and [TypeScript](). If you are using a different framework,
you can still use the UI Composites by using our TypeScript Loader functions for each of the composites.

These functions mount each of our React Composites to your applications DOM. The Functions that are available are:

- `loadChatComposite`
- `loadCallComposite`
- `loadCallWithChatComposite`
- `loadOutboundCallComposite`

## How they work

Since all different [Node]() frameworks are just JavaScript, CSS, and HTML you can use each of the
different frameworks inside each other. In the case of using [React]() inside your application you would use
the `createRoot` function to attach a React node to your application and then use your react component inside that.

Our loader functions work in a similar way. They take a DOM element and attach the React Composite to that element. What this means
is that you can use the UI Composites in any framework that can render HTML elements to the DOM.
