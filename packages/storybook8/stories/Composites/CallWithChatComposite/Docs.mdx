# CallWithChatComposite

CallWithChatComposite brings together key components to provide a full call with chat experience out of the box.
Inside the experience users can configure their devices, participate in the call with video and see other
participants, including those with video turned on. The experience includes chat capabilities like sending and
receiving messages, and notifications for message thread events such as typing indicators, message receipts,
participants entering and leaving the chat.

</Stack>

## Basic usage

A CallWithChatComposite is comprised of two key underlying parts: an ACS Call and an ACS Chat thread. As
such you must provide details for both in the CallWithChatAdapter interface.

A key thing to note is that initialization of the adapter is asynchronous. Thus, the initialization step
requires special handling, as the example code below shows.

<Source code={containerText} />

## Prerequisites

CallWithChatComposite provides the UI for an _existing user_ to join a call and a chat. Thus, the user and
thread must be created beforehand. Typically, the user and group call or teams meeting are created on a
Contoso-owned service and provided to the client application that then passes it to the CallWithChatComposite.

<Source code={serverText} />

## Running in a Mobile browser

CallWithChatComposite by default is optimized for desktop views. To provide an optimized mobile experience, you
may set the `formFactor` property to `"mobile"`. The CallWithChatComposite does not detect if it is running on
mobile device vs desktop, instead you must identify if your clients device is a mobile device and set the
`formFactor` property to `"mobile"`. This prop can be set at any time and immediately updates the composite UI
to be optimized for a mobile device.

<Source code={`<CallWithChatComposite formFactor="mobile" />`} />
<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <Image src="images/call-with-chat-composite-mobile-hero.png" alt="Call with chat composite mobile preview image" />
</Stack>
<Note>
  {' '}
  Note: Only Portrait mode is supported when the `formFactor` is set to "mobile". Landscape mode is not supported.{' '}
</Note>
You can try out the form factor property in the [CallWithChatComposite Basic
Example](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-basicexample-basic-example--basic-example).

Mobile devices have a pull-down to refresh feature that may impact users from scrolling through messages in
chat. A simple and effective way to disable the pull-down to refresh feature is to set an `overflow='hidden'` OR
`touch-action='none'` style on the body element for your app.

## Theming

CallWithChatComposite can be themed with Fluent UI themes, just like the base components. Look at the
[CallComposite theme example](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite-theme-example--theme-example) to see theming in
action or the [overall theming example](./?path=/docs/concepts-theming--docs) to see how theming works for all the
components in this UI library.

## Custom Branding

Along with applying a Fluent Theme to style the composites, you can also inject your own custom branding. You
can inject a background and logo into the Composite configuration page to present to your users. This is done by
passing background and logo properties to the `options` of the Composite.

**Image recommendations.** The background image should be as simple and uncluttered as possible to avoid text
becoming unreadable against the background. The background image should have a minimum size of 576x576 pixels
and a maximum size of 2048x2048 pixels. The recommended size is 1280x720 pixels. The recommended size for the
logo image is 128x128 pixels.

<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <img
    style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '50rem' }}
    src="images/composite-logo-background.png"
    alt="CallWithChatComposite with a logo and background applied"
  />
</Stack>
<Source
  code={`
<CallWithChatComposite options={{
  branding: {
    logo: {
      url: 'https://...',
      alt: 'My company logo',
      shape: 'circle'
    },
    backgroundImage: {
      url: 'https://...'
    }
  }
}} />
`}
/>

## Customize Call Controls

CallWithChatComposite provides a set of default controls for the call that can be customized similar to
CallComposite. Check out [Customize Call Controls](./?path=/docs/composites-callcomposite--docs#customize-call-controls)
to learn more.

## Customizing Screen Sharing

We offer enhanced screen sharing capabilities during video calls. By default, what you share is rendered on your own screen, providing a seamless experience for both you and other participants. Alternatively, we provide a legacy view that simply shows a placeholder indicating that you’re sharing your screen—giving you the flexibility to select the experience that best suits your needs.

### Presenter’s Perspective (default)

While screen sharing, the call window displays the shared content back to the presenter, making it clear that screen sharing is active.

### Presenter Notification Layout (legacy)

While screen sharing, the call window displays a grey placeholder to the presenter, indicating that screen sharing is active.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '0.5rem'}}>
  <Stack>
    Presenter perspective layout
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '30rem' }}
      src="images/callcomposite-screenshare-default.png"
      alt="Dynamic layout for composite video gallery"
    />
    <div style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '30rem' }}>

    ```ts
    <CallWithChatComposite options={galleryOptions: {localScreenShareView: 'stream'}} />
    ```

    </div>
    - this is default and you will not need this code at all

  </Stack>
  <Stack>
    Presenter notification layout
      <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '30rem' }}
        src="images/callcomposite-screenshare-legacy.png"
        alt="Focused content layout for composite video gallery"
      />
    <div style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '30rem' }}>

    ```ts
    <CallWithChatComposite options={galleryOptions: {localScreenShareView: 'placeholderMessage'}} />
    ```

    </div>

  </Stack>
</Stack>

### FAQ:

#### Why is it that when I am screensharing, I’m seeing a recursive view of my screen?

When you share your screen during a video call and choose to render what you are sharing, you might end up sharing the call window itself. This creates a recursive effect where the shared screen displays the call window, which in turn shows the shared screen again, leading to an infinite recursion effect. This behavior is enabled automatically as part of the default experience and allows users to see that screen sharing is enabled and working.

{' '}
<img
  style={{ width: '100%' }}
  src="images/callcomposite-screenshare-recursive.png"
  alt="Focused content layout for composite video gallery"
/>
To avoid this recursion, you can opt for the alternate or legacy view, where the shared screen will display a grey
placeholder instead of the call window. This way, you can prevent the infinite recursion effect and still indicate that
screen sharing is active.

## Adding image sharing

### Inline Image In Teams Interop Meeting Chat Thread

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

The Azure Communication Services end user can receive images shared by the Teams user without any additional
setup when using the `CallWithChat` Composite in a Teams interop scenario. An Azure Communication Services end
user would need to join the Teams meeting first, as soon as the Teams user sends an image from the Teams
client, the Azure Communication Services end user will see it in the chat thread.

<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <Image src="images/call-with-chat-inline-image.png" alt="Call with chat composite with inline image" width="85%" />
</Stack>

### Known Limitations

- Support for sending an image from an ACS end user to a Teams user requires using [Rich Text Editor](./?path=/docs/composites-chatcomposite--docs#rich-text-editor-support).
- Certain GIF images may not be supported at this time and the user will receive a static image instead.
- No support for Clips (short videos) sent by the Teams users at this time.

## Adding file sharing

### File Sharing In Azure Communication Services Chat Thread

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

In a chat thread where all participants are Azure Communication Services end users, the `CallWithChat`
Composite supports file capabilities in conjunction with your choice of a storage solution. Using the provided
APIs, you can composite to support uploading files and displaying them on the send box before sending, and the
once they have been sent or received. For an end to end tutorial on enabling file sharing with Azure Blob
Storage as your choice of a storage solution, refer to our
[tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/tutorials/file-sharing-tutorial).

<Source
  code={`<CallWithChatComposite
adapter={chatAdapter}
options={{
  attachmentOptions: {
    uploadOptions: {
      supportedMediaTypes: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg'],
      disableMultipleUploads: false,
      handler: attachmentUploadHandler
    },
    /* If downloadOptions is not provided. The file URL is opened in a new tab.
    You can find examples of downloadOptions and uploadOptions in this tutorial
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/tutorials/file-sharing-tutorial */
    downloadOptions: {
      actionsForAttachment: (attachment: AttachmentMetadata, message?: ChatMessage): AttachmentMenuAction[] => {
        return [
          defaultAttachmentMenuAction,
          {
            name: 'Open',
            icon: <WindowNew24Regular />,
            onClick: () => {
              return new Promise((resolve) => {
                window.alert('open button clicked');
                resolve();
              });
            }
          }
        ];
      }
    }
  }
}} />`}
/>

### File Sharing In Teams Interop Meeting Chat Thread

When using the `CallWithChat` Composite in a Teams interop scenario, the Azure Communication Services end user
can receive file attachments from Teams user without any additional setup. Simply join the Teams meeting as an
Azure Communication Services end user, as soon as the Teams user sends a file from the Teams client, the Azure
Communication Services end user will be able to see shared files in the chat thread.

#### Permissions

When a file is shared from a Teams client, the Teams user has options to set the file permissions to be:

- "Anyone"
- "People in your organization"
- "People currently in this chat"
- "People with existing access"
- "People you choose"

Specifically, the UI library currently only supports "Anyone" and "People you choose" (with email address) and
all other permissions aren't supported. If Teams user sent a file with unsupported permissions, the Azure
Communication Services end user might be prompted to a login page or denied access when they click on the file
attachment in the chat thread.

<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <Image src="images/call-with-chat-file-sharing-permissions.png" alt="File sharing permissions" />
</Stack>

Moreover, the Teams user's tenant admin might impose restrictions on file sharing, including disabling some file permissions or disabling file sharing option all together.

## PSTN and 1:N Calling

<Note> Note: see CallComposite for detailed implementation description </Note>

The CallWithChatComposite supports the PSTN Calling modality as well. With CallWithChat you will need to still
provide a chat thread Id for instances where you will add a Azure Communications user to the call. If you are
looking to use the CallWithChatComposite and are looking to hide the chat because you are only calling PSTN
users please see our documentation on how to hide the [control bar
buttons](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-basicexample-basic-example--basic-example).

## Rich Text Editor Support

<SingleLineBetaBanner />
<Note> Note: see ChatComposite for detailed implementation description </Note>

The CallWithChatComposite supports options to enable a rich text editor functionality in chat similar to
ChatComposite. Check out [Rich Text Editor Support for
ChatComposite](./?path=/docs/composites-chatcomposite--docs#rich-text-editor-support) to learn
more.
