# CallWithChatComposite

CallWithChatComposite brings together key components to provide a full call with chat experience out of the box.
Inside the experience users can configure their devices, participate in the call with video and see other
participants, including those with video turned on. The experience includes chat capabilities like sending and
receiving messages, and notifications for message thread events such as typing indicators, message receipts,
participants entering and leaving the chat.

## Basic usage

A CallWithChatComposite is comprised of two key underlying parts: an ACS Call and an ACS Chat thread. As
such you must provide details for both in the CallWithChatAdapter interface.

A key thing to note is that initialization of the adapter is asynchronous. Thus, the initialization step
requires special handling, as the example code below shows.

<Source code={containerText} />

## Prerequisites

CallWithChatComposite provides the UI for an _existing user_ to join a call and a chat. Thus, the user and
thread must be created beforehand. Typically, the user and group call or teams meeting are created on a
Contoso-owned service and provided to the client application that then passes it to the CallWithChatComposite.

<Source code={serverText} />

## Running in a Mobile browser

CallWithChatComposite by default is optimized for desktop views. To provide an optimized mobile experience, you
may set the `formFactor` property to `"mobile"`. The CallWithChatComposite does not detect if it is running on
mobile device vs desktop, instead you must identify if your clients device is a mobile device and set the
`formFactor` property to `"mobile"`. This prop can be set at any time and immediately updates the composite UI
to be optimized for a mobile device.

<Source code={`<CallWithChatComposite formFactor="mobile" />`} />
<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <Image src="images/call-with-chat-composite-mobile-hero.png" alt="Call with chat composite mobile preview image" />
</Stack>
<MessageBar>
  Note: Only Portrait mode is supported when the `formFactor` is set to "mobile". Landscape mode is not supported.
</MessageBar>
You can try out the form factor property in the [CallWithChatComposite Basic
Example](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-basicexample-basic-example--basic-example).

Mobile devices have a pull-down to refresh feature that may impact users from scrolling through messages in
chat. A simple and effective way to disable the pull-down to refresh feature is to set an `overflow='hidden'` OR
`touch-action='none'` style on the body element for your app.

## Theming

CallWithChatComposite can be themed with Fluent UI themes, just like the base components. Look at the
[CallComposite theme example](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite-theme-example--theme-example) to see theming in
action or the [overall theming example](./?path=/docs/concepts-theming--docs) to see how theming works for all the
components in this UI library.

## Custom Branding

Along with applying a Fluent Theme to style the composites, you can also inject your own custom branding. You
can inject a background and logo into the Composite configuration page to present to your users. This is done by
passing background and logo properties to the `options` of the Composite.

**Image recommendations.** The background image should be as simple and uncluttered as possible to avoid text
becoming unreadable against the background. The background image should have a minimum size of 576x576 pixels
and a maximum size of 2048x2048 pixels. The recommended size is 1280x720 pixels. The recommended size for the
logo image is 128x128 pixels.

<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <img
    style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '50rem' }}
    src="images/composite-logo-background.png"
    alt="CallWithChatComposite with a logo and background applied"
  />
</Stack>
<Source
  code={`
<CallWithChatComposite options={{
  branding: {
    logo: {
      url: 'https://...',
      alt: 'My company logo',
      shape: 'circle'
    },
    backgroundImage: {
      url: 'https://...'
    }
  }
}} />
`}
/>

## Customize Call Controls

## Adding file sharing

### File Sharing In Azure Communication Services Chat Thread

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

In a chat thread where all participants are Azure Communication Services end users, the `CallWithChat`
Composite supports file capabilities in conjunction with your choice of a storage solution. Using the provided
APIs, you can composite to support uploading files and displaying them on the send box before sending, and the
once they have been sent or received. For an end to end tutorial on enabling file sharing with Azure Blob
Storage as your choice of a storage solution, refer to our
[tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/tutorials/file-sharing-tutorial).

<Source
  code={`<CallWithChatComposite
adapter={chatAdapter}
options={{
  attachmentOptions: {
    uploadOptions: {
      supportedMediaTypes: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg'],
      disableMultipleUploads: false,
      handler: attachmentUploadHandler
    },
    /* If downloadOptions is not provided. The file URL is opened in a new tab.
    You can find examples of downloadOptions and uploadOptions in this tutorial
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/tutorials/file-sharing-tutorial */
    downloadOptions: {
      actionsForAttachment: (attachment: AttachmentMetadata, message?: ChatMessage): AttachmentMenuAction[] => {
        return [
          defaultAttachmentMenuAction,
          {
            name: 'Open',

<MessageBar>Note: see CallComposite for detailed implementation description</MessageBar>

The CallWithChatComposite supports the PSTN Calling modality as well. With CallWithChat you will need to still
provide a chat thread Id for instances where you will add a Azure Communications user to the call. If you are
looking to use the CallWithChatComposite and are looking to hide the chat because you are only calling PSTN
users please see our documentation on how to hide the [control bar
buttons](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-basicexample-basic-example--basic-example).
