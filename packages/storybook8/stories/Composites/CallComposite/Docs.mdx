# CallComposite

The CallComposite provides a calling experience that allows users to start or join a call. Inside the experience
users can configure their devices, participate in the call with video and see other participants, including
those with video turned on. Here are visual examples of Call composite where participants have their camera
turned off, then some have them turned on. People speaking with microphone unmuted will have their tile
appearing with a blue border.

When joining a Microsoft Teams call ([Teams Interop experience](./?path=/docs/concepts-teams-interop-compliance-banner--docs)), the Call Composite
includes a lobby experience where the user is waiting to be admitted into the call.

Note that CallComposite has the following min width and height:

- mobile: 17.5rem x 21rem (280px x 336px, with default rem at 16px)
- desktop: 30rem x 22rem (480px x 352px, with default rem at 16px)

## Basic usage

There are two parts to the composite - a `CallComposite` react component and a `CallAdapter` that connects the
react component to the backend APIs.

The key thing to note is that initialization of `CallAdapter` is asynchronous. Thus, the initialization step
requires special handling, as the example code below shows.

<Source code={containerText} />

## Prerequisites

CallComposite provides the UI for an _existing user_ to join a call. The user must be created beforehand.
Typically, the user and group call or teams meeting are created on a Contoso-owned service and provided to the
client application that then passes it to the CallComposite.

## Styling

CallComposite is designed to fill the space of the parent it is in. By default these examples put the composite
in a container of a set height and width. If your composite is living outside of any parent container and you
wish for it to fill the page, we recommend ensuring your react app is set to fill the screen by adding the
following css to your primary css file:

```ts
html,
body,
#root {
  height: 100%;
}
```

## Running in a Mobile browser

CallComposite by default is optimized for desktop views. To provide an optimized mobile experience, you may set
the `formFactor` property to `"mobile"`. The CallComposite does not detect if it is running on mobile device vs
desktop, instead you must identify if your clients device is a mobile device and set the `formFactor` property
to `"mobile"`. This prop can be set at any time and immediately updates the composite UI to be optimized for a
mobile device.

```ts
<CallComposite formFactor="mobile" />
```

<Note>
  {' '}
  Note: Only Portrait mode is supported when the `formFactor` is set to "mobile". Landscape mode is not supported.{' '}
</Note>

You can try out the form factor property in the [CallComposite Basic Example](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite--basic-example).

## Theming

CallComposite can be themed with Fluent UI themes, just like the base components. Look at the [CallComposite
theme example](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite-theme-example--theme-example) to see theming in action or the
[overall theming example](./?path=/docs/concepts-theming--docs) to see how theming works for all the components in this
UI library.

## Custom Branding

Along with applying a Fluent Theme to style the composites, you can also inject your own custom branding. You
can inject a background and logo into the Composite configuration page to present to your users. This is done by
passing background and logo properties to the `options` of the Composite.

**Image recommendations.** The background image should be as simple and uncluttered as possible to avoid text
becoming unreadable against the background. The background image should have a minimum size of 576x576 pixels
and a maximum size of 2048x2048 pixels. The recommended size is 1280x720 pixels. The recommended size for the
logo image is 128x128 pixels.

<Stack horizontalAlign="center">
  <img
    style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '50rem' }}
    src="images/composite-logo-background.png"
    alt="CallComposite with a logo and background applied"
  />
</Stack>

```ts
<CallComposite options={{
  branding: {
    logo: {
      url: 'https://...',
      alt: 'My company logo',
      shape: 'circle'
    },
    backgroundImage: {
      url: 'https://...'
    }
  }
}} />
```

## Custom Data Model

It is a primary tenet of Azure Communication Services that customers bring their own user identities.
Customers then use the Azure Communication Services identity service to create corresponding authentication
tokens for their users. The CallComposite allows developers to easily inject custom data associated with these
user identities. Look at the [example
canvas](./?path=/story/composites-callcomposite--custom-data-model-example) to see how the
initials displayed for users can be provided by Contoso.

Note that, by default, the initials text color is setup to `white`

<Source code={customDataModelExampleContainerText} />

See the [Custom data model example documentation](./?path=/docs/concepts-custom-user-data-model--docs) to understand how
custom data model can be injected for all the components in this UI library.

## Fonts

Custom fonts can be applied to the CallComposite using the in built theming mechanism. Look at the
[CallComposite themes canvas](./?path=/docs/examples-themes-teams--docs) to see custom fonts in
action or the [overall theming example](./?path=/docs/concepts-theming--docs) to see how theming works for all the
components in this UI library. Read more about fonts in [Fluent UI
Typography](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/styles/web/typography).

## Icons

Custom icons can be applied to the Composite using `icons` prop exposed by the Composite. The `icons` prop
accepts an object where you can provide a custom JSX element against an icon name key.

## Handling Call Ended

By default the `CallComposite` shows a `CallEnded` screen when the call ends. However, in your application you will likely want to take some action when the call ends.
The `CallComposite` adapter emits a `callEnded` event when the call ends. You can listen to this event and
take appropriate action. For example, you can present new UI or navigate to a different page when the call ends.

```ts
const handleCallEnded = () => {
  // Take appropriate action when the call ends
  window.location.href = '/call-ended';
};

adapter.on('callEnded', handleCallEnded);
```

The call may end successfully (e.g., by the user leaving the call) or by something undesired (e.g., being removed from the meeting).
The `callEndReason` can be used to detect the reason for the call ending, and, if necessary in your application, take appropriate action.

Here is an example of how you could show various UI based on the call end reason:

```tsx
// Call Ended Reasons the application will opt to handle
enum CallEndReasons {
  LEFT_CALL,
  ACCESS_DENIED,
  REMOVED_FROM_CALL,
  BAD_REQUEST
}

// Convert from raw call end codes and subcodes to the application's CallEndReasons
// For more details refer to: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/resources/troubleshooting/voice-video-calling/troubleshooting-codes?pivots=callend
const convertCallEndReason = (callEndedData: CallEndReason | undefined): CallEndReasons => {
  const ACCESS_DENIED_TEAMS_MEETING_SUB_CODE = 5854;
  const REMOVED_FROM_CALL_SUB_CODES = [5000, 5300];

  if (callEndedData?.subCode === ACCESS_DENIED_TEAMS_MEETING_SUB_CODE) {
    return CallEndReasons.ACCESS_DENIED;
  } else if (callEndedData?.code === 400) {
    return CallEndReasons.BAD_REQUEST;
  } else if (callEndedData?.subCode === 4000 && REMOVED_FROM_CALL_SUB_CODES.includes(callEndedData.subCode)) {
    return CallEndReasons.REMOVED_FROM_CALL;
  } else {
    return CallEndReasons.LEFT_CALL;
  }
};

const CallApp = (props: {adapter: CallAdapter}) => {
  const { adapter } = props;
  const [callEndReason, setCallEndReason] = useState<CallEndReasons | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleCallEnded = (): void => {
      const callEndedData = adapter.getState().endedCall?.callEndReason;
      setCallEndReason(convertCallEndReason(callEndedData));
    };
    adapter.on('callEnded', handleCallEnded);
    return () => {
      adapter.off('callEnded', handleCallEnded);
    };
  }, [adapter, getCallEndReason, setCallEndReason]);

  if (callEndReason === CallEndReasons.ACCESS_DENIED) {
    return <div>Access Denied</div>;
  }
  if (callEndReason === CallEndReasons.REMOVED_FROM_CALL) {
    return <div>Removed from call</div>;
  }
  if (callEndReason === CallEndReasons.BAD_REQUEST) {
    return <div>Bad Request</div>;
  }
  if (callEndReason === CallEndReasons.LEFT_CALL) {
    return <div>Left call</div>;
  }

  return <CallComposite adapter={adapter}>
}
```

## Customize Call Controls

The `options` prop allows you to customize some parts of the Call Composite. This prop is of type
[CallCompositeOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/communication-react/callcompositeoptions?view=azure-node-latest).
The `callControls` property can be used to customize the call controls. This property is of type
[CallControlOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/communication-react/callcontroloptions?view=azure-node-latest).

For example, you can hide the camera button by using `callControls` as shown below:

```ts
<CallComposite options={{ callControls: { cameraButton: false } }} />
```

You can display the call controls in a compact mode using `callControls` as shown below:

```ts
<CallComposite options={{ callControls: { displayType: 'compact' } }} />
```

You can disable some call controls (refer to
[CallControlOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/communication-react/callcontroloptions?view=azure-node-latest))
using `callControls` as shown below:

```ts
<CallComposite options={{ callControls: { screenShareButton: { disabled: true } } }} />
```

### End Call Modal

Our `CallComposite` is able to use the end call for everyone functionality found on the end call button. This
functionality will end the call for everyone present in the call. As such it will present the user with a
confirmation modal to make sure that the action of ending, or leaving the call was intentional. This mode can be
turned on with the following snippet.

```ts
<CallComposite options={{ callControls: { endCallButton: { hangUpForEveryone: 'endCallOptions' } } }} />
```

With this mode the `EndCallButton` will always present the user with a confirmation modal before ending the
call. If you are wanting to end the call without the confirmation modal you can use the following snippet to
disable the confirmation.

```ts
<CallComposite options={{ callControls: { endCallButton: { disableEndCallModal: true } } }} />
```

## Customize Local Video Tile

Just like customizing the control bar we have some configuration options for the local video tile. These
controls are to help facilitate different calling experiences like creating an audio only call.

These options allow for you to decide which part of the gallery that the composite shows the local video tile.
We currently support controls to show the local video tile in either the `grid view` of the gallery or in the
`floating` position we see today.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '1rem' }}>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
      src="images/storybook-grid-layout.png"
      alt="Grid layout for composite video gallery"
    />
    Call Composite with `grid` layout.
  </Stack>
  <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
      src="images/storybook-floating-layout.png"
      alt="Floating layout for composite video gallery"
    />
    Call Composite with `floating` layout.
  </Stack>
</Stack>

```ts
<CallComposite options={localVideoTileOptions: {position: 'grid'}} />
```

```ts
<CallComposite options={localVideoTileOptions: {position: 'floating'}} />
```

Just like the `CallControlOptions` we can also disable the local video tile from the gallery by providing false
instead of the options object.

```ts
<CallComposite options={localVideoTileOptions: false} />
```

This will hide the local video tile from the composite's video gallery. The default value is `floating` which
will have the local video tile follow our `floatingLocalLayout`. See our [video
gallery](./?path=/docs/components-video-gallery--docs) component docs for more information on our
local video tile and some of the other options we have for the local video tile when just using the components.

## Customizing the default Gallery Layout

We allow for the customization of the starting layout of the gallery. The layout can be changed by the user
though the gallery options menu found in the more button of the call controls.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '1rem' }}>
  <Stack>
    <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
      <img
        style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
        src="images/callcomposite-dynamic-layout.png"
        alt="Dynamic layout for composite video gallery"
      />
      Call Composite with `dynamic` layout.
    </Stack>
    <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
      <img
        style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
        src="images/callcomposite-focused-content.png"
        alt="Focused content layout for composite video gallery"
      />
      Call Composite with `focused content` layout.
    </Stack>
  </Stack>
  <Stack>
    <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
      <img
        style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
        src="images/callcomposite-gallery-layout.png"
        alt="Gallery layout for composite video gallery"
      />
      Call Composite with `gallery` layout.
    </Stack>
    <Stack horizontalAlign="center">
      <img
        style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '25rem' }}
        src="images/callcomposite-speaker-layout.png"
        alt="Speaker layout for composite video gallery"
      />
      Call Composite with `speaker` layout.
    </Stack>
  </Stack>
</Stack>

You can set the gallery layout using the following:

```ts
<CallComposite options={galleryOptions: {layout: 'speaker'}} />
```

```ts
<CallComposite options={galleryOptions: {layout: 'default'}} />
```

```ts
<CallComposite options={galleryOptions: {layout: 'floatingLocalVideo'}} />
```

```ts
<CallComposite options={galleryOptions: {layout: 'focusedContent'}} />
```

## PSTN and 1:N Calling

<SingleLineBetaBanner version={'1.3.2-beta.1'} />

The CallComposite supports making outbound PSTN and 1:N calls. 1:N is a call either between just Azure
Communication Users or, a mix between ACS and PSTN users. To make these outbound calls you need to provide an
array of `targetCallees` that contains participantIds that you are looking to call to the
[CallAdapter](./?path=/docs/composites-adapters--docs). For PSTN these IDs are the phone numbers that you are
looking to call. For Azure Communication Users you will need to provide their unique ACS acquired `userId`.
These are to be provided to the `CallAdapter` properties in place of a locator as `targetCallees`.

```ts
// You will want to make sure that any flat id's are converted to CommunicationUserIdentifier or PhoneNumberIdentifier
const createTargetCallees = (targetCallees: string[]): CommunicationUserIdentifier[] => {
  return targetCallees.map((c) => fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier(c) as CommunicationUserIdentifier);
};

const createTargetCallees = useMemo(() => {
  return participantIds.map((c) => fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier(c) as PhoneNumberIdentifier);
}, [participantIds]);
```

As well as these participantIds you are required to provide a [phone
number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azcli)
known as an alternate caller ID from an Azure Communications resource to the composite's adapter for PSTN. This
phone number serves as your caller ID when calling PSTN. This phone number is not required for calling other
Azure Communications users, however, will be required if you are looking to call a ACS user and a PSTN user in
the same call.

## Rooms

The CallComposite supports [Rooms](./?path=/docs/concepts-rooms--docs). To join a room call you need to provide a
`locator` that contains the roomId of the room call you want to join to the
[CallAdapter](./?path=/docs/composites-adapters--docs). An example snippet is shown in the 'How to incorporate
Rooms in your experience' section in our [Rooms doc](./?path=/docs/concepts-rooms--docs).

Note: A room needs be created using the Rooms Client to obtain a roomId. Also with the Rooms Client, ACS users
need to be added to that room using their userId. To use the Rooms Client to create a room follow these
[quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/rooms/get-started-rooms).
