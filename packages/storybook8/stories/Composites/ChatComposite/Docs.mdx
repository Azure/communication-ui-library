# ChatComposite

ChatComposite provides a chat experience where user can send and receive messages. Message thread events such as
typing indicators, whether the message has been successfully delivered or read, or participants entering and
leaving the chat are displayed to the user as part of the chat thread. Here is a visual example of Chat
composite.

<Stack style={overviewPageImagesStackStyle}>
  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      style={{ width: '100%' }}
      src="images/chatComposite_NoParticipantsList.png"
      alt="Chat composite with the participants list"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
</Stack>
Note that ChatComposite has a min width and height of respectively 17.5rem and 20rem (280px x 320px, with default rem at
16px).

## Basic Usage

There are two parts to the composite - a `ChatComposite` react component and a `ChatAdapter` that connects the
react component to the backend APIs.

The key thing to note is that initialization of `ChatAdapter` is asynchronous. Thus, the initialization step
requires special handling, as the example code below shows.

<Source code={containerText} />

## Prerequisites

ChatComposite provides the UI for an _existing user_ in an _existing thread_. Thus, the user and thread must be
created beforehand. Typically, the user and thread are created on a Contoso-owned service and authentication
tokens are served to the client application that then passes it to the ChatComposite.

## Theming

ChatComposite can be themed with Fluent UI themes, just like the base components. Look at the [ChatComposite
themes canvas](./?path=/story/composites-chatcomposite-theme-example--theme-example) to see theming in action or the
[overall theming example](./?path=/docs/concepts-theming--docs) to see how theming works for all the components in
this UI library.

## Fonts

Custom fonts can be applied to the ChatComposite using the in built theming mechanism. Look at the
[ChatComposite themes canvas](./?path=/story/composites-chatcomposite-theme-example--theme-example) to see custom fonts
in action or the [overall theming example](./?path=/docs/concepts-theming--docs) to see how theming works for all the
components in this UI library. Read more about fonts in [Fluent UI Typography
here](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/styles/web/typography).

## Icons

Custom icons can be applied to the Composite using `icons` prop exposed by the Composite. The `icons` prop
accepts an object where you can provide a custom JSX element against an icon name key.

## Hiding/Showing UI Elements

Some UI elements of the composite can be hidden if desired using the ChatAdapter `options` interface. Currently
we support hiding the `Topic Header`:

```ts
<ChatComposite options={{ topic: false }} />
```

## Participant Pane

<SingleLineBetaBanner />
You can also show a `Participant Pane` to the right hand side of the chat that has support for removing users. The
Participant pane is a `beta` feature. Currently it does not support mobile views and is subject to breaking changes.

```ts
  // Caution: the Participant Pane is a beta feature
<ChatComposite options={{ participantPane: true}}>
```

## Running in a Mobile browser

Unlike the CallComposite and CallWithChatComposite, the ChatComposite has no `formFactor` property. Instead the
composite is responsive to the container it is in and should perform optimally on mobile and desktop
automatically.

Mobile devices have a pull-down to refresh feature that may impact users from scrolling through messages in
chat. A simple and effective way to disable the pull-down to refresh feature is to set an `overflow='hidden'` OR
`touch-action='none'` style on the body element for your app.

## Custom Data Model

It is a primary tenet of Azure Communication Services that customers bring their own user identities.
Customers then use the Azure Communication Services identity service to create corresponding authentication
tokens for their users. The ChatComposite allows developers to easily inject custom data associated with these
user identities. Look at the [example
canvas](./?path=/story/composites-chatcomposite-custom-data-model-example--custom-data-model-example) to see how the name
and avatar displayed for users can be provided by Contoso.

Note that, by default, the initials text color is setup to `white`

<Source code={customDataModelExampleContainerText} />

See the [Custom data model example documentation](./?path=/docs/concepts-custom-user-data-model--docs) to understand how
custom data model can be injected for all the components in this UI library.

## Customize Behavior

The `ChatAdapter` makes it possible to arbitrarily modify the communication between the `ChatComposite`
component and the Azure Communication Services backend. This adds powerful customization possibilities. The
[Customized Behavior Example](./?path=/story/composites-chatcomposite-custom-behavior-example--custom-behavior-example)
shows a way to intercept messages entered by the user and modify them before sending them on to the backend.

<Source code={customBehaviorExampleText} />

## Joining existing Chat

The [join existing chat thread](./?path=/story/composites-chatcomposite-join-existing-chat-thread--join-existing-chat-thread)
provides an easy playground to join an existing Azure Communication Services chat thread. This is useful if you
want to explore the composite with multiple users.

## Custom DateTime Format using Locale

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

You can pass in a function that formats the datetime displayed in chat messages through Locale

<Source code={customDateTimeFormatExampleText} />

## Adding file sharing

<SingleLineBetaBanner />
### In Azure Communication Service Chat Thread

The Chat Composite supports file sharing capabilities in conjunction with your choice of a storage solution.
Please refer to our
[tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/tutorials/file-sharing-tutorial) for more
details. File sharing in Teams interop scenarios is available with the CallWithChat Composite.

## Rich Text Editor Support

<SingleLineBetaBanner />

The following example show how to enable rich text editor for message editing by providing the `richTextEditor` property.
The insert inline images feature is only supported in the Teams Interop chats. Please try it out in the [Join Teams Meeting](./?path=/story/composites-callwithchatcomposite-join-teams-meeting--join-teams-meeting) page.
