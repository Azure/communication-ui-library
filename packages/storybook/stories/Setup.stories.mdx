# Setting up your app to use Azure Communications UI Library

Currently the Azure Communications UI library supports react versions `>=16.8.0` and `< 18`

When following this setup guide, the react version bundled with the `create-react-app` will need
to be downgraded from react 18 to a supported react version. This page will cover which packages that need downgrading and files
that need to be edited to get you up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started make sure you have all the following prerequisites set up and ready to go.

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 14.19.0 and above).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp).
- An identity with both VoIP and Chat scopes. Generate an identity using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).

## Setting Up

UI Library requires a React environment to be setup. Next we will do that.

### Set Up React App

We'll use the create-react-app typescript template for our application. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

npx create-react-app your-ui-lib-application --template typescript

cd your-ui-lib-application

```

### Revert `index.tsx` to older version

The latest `creat-react-app` template is incompatible with React 16/17 libraries.
Replace the content of the generated `index.tsx` file with the following snippet
so that it works with the target React versions:

<Source code={indexText} />

**Note:** Various tutorials in this documentation modify the contents of the generated `App.tsx` file.
The `index.tsx` file should look identical for all the tutorials, as shown here.

### Setting up your React app packages

Since React 18 also updates all of its dependencies we will need to make sure that we downgrade the react packages present in
react versions between `16.8.0` and `< 18`.

We recommend the following configuration of React-related dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.5",
    "@testing-library/react-hooks": "^3.4.2",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "@types/jest": "^27.5.2",
    "@types/node": "^16.11.49",
    "@types/react": "^16.9.49",
    "@types/react-dom": "^16.9.8",
    "react": "~16.14.0",
    "react-dom": "16.13.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.1.2",
    "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
    "react-test-renderer": "^16.14.0",
    "reactstrap": "^8.4.1",
    "typescript": "^4.7.4",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
}
```

Should you want to update anything make sure that it is compatible with react versions `< 18`

### Installing the Package

#### Package prequiresites

The Azure Communication UI Library supports the following minimum versions:

- `typescript` >= 3.7.0
- `webpack` >= 5.3.8

#### npm install

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Library for JavaScript.

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-react
```

`@azure/communication-react` specifies core AzureCommunication Services as `peerDependencies` so that you
can most consistently user the API from the core libraries in your application. You need to install those libraries as well:

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.4.4
npm install @azure/communication-chat@1.2.0
```

To try out our [composite adapters](./?path=/docs/quickstarts-composites--page) snippets you will need to install `uuid`

```bash
npm install uuid
npm install @types/uuid
```

### Working with our beta features

If you are looking to experiment with our latest beta calling features, ensure to install the corresponding beta dependencies.

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-calling@next
```

### Testing your app

You need to downgrade or consider removing the provided `App.test.tsx` file. This is because it is
using the new testing library `@testing-library/react` which is not compatible with versions of react `< 18`. If this file is not modified, the app will fail to build correctly in the next step.

### Run Create React App

Finally, you can now run the app using the command below:

```bash
npm run start
```

To start your application in development mode.
