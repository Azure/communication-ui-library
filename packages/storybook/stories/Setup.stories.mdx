# Setting up your app to use Azure Communications UI Library

Currently the Azure Communications UI library supports react versions `>= 16.8.0` or ` < 18`

Using the UI library in react developers will need to downgrade the version of react that they are currently
getting from `create-react-app`. This page talks about packages that need downgrading and files that should be edited.

## Setting Up

UI Library requires a React environment to be setup. Next we will do that. If you already have a React App, you can skip this section.

### Set Up React App

We'll use the create-react-app template for this quickstart. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

npx create-react-app your-ui-lib-application --template typescript

cd your-ui-lib-application

```

### Editing your files

Once the create script has finished you will need to edit your `index.tsx` file to a older version.

<Source code={indexText} />

The newest version of react react 18 changes how your index.tsx file would look so this change is needed. In our
various tutorials we will show you how to setup your `App.tsx` file but `index.tsx` needs to be updated in
this way due to changes to `ReactDom` in `React 18`.
