# React Versioning

Using the UI library in react developers will need to downgrade the version of react that they are currently
getting from `create-react-app`. This guide will talk about packages in `create-react-app` that need to be
downgraded, as well files that the script generates that will need to be updated.

## Setting Up

UI Library requires a React environment to be setup. Next we will do that. If you already have a React App, you can skip this section.

### Set Up React App

We'll use the create-react-app template for this quickstart. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

npx create-react-app ui-library-quickstart-composites --template typescript

cd ui-library-quickstart-composites

```
