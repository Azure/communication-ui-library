# Transfer

<DetailedBetaBanner version={'1.6.1-beta.1'} />

## Overview

During an active call, a participant can transfer another participant to another user or call. The transfer process
starts when a participant (the transferor) requests to transfer another participant (the transferee) to another
participant (the transfer target.) The transferee receives a transfer requested event which they can accept or reject.
If the request is accepted, then the transferee makes an outgoing call to transfer target. Finally, the call is ended
by the transferor.

In the current beta version, ACS users cannot request to transfer other participants yet but they can receive transfer
requests. Currently, only Teams users can request to transfer other participants. To make a call to a Teams user, refer
to the [Adhoc calling page](path=/docs/adhoc-calling--page).

## Handling transfer requests

The [CallAdapter](path=/docs/composite-adapters--page#call-adapter) is able to receive `transferRequested` events and
allows you to handle these events by defining your own `TransferRequestedListener` callback. The following code snippet
shows an example of a `TransferRequestedListener` that accepts all `transferRequested` events.

When a transfer request is accepted with no `AcceptTransferOptions`, the microphone state and camera state are
maintained from the original call to the transferred call. But you can provide `AcceptTransferOptions` to the `accept`
function so that the user's microphone is muted and their camera turned off in the transferred call. This is done by
changing the `afterCallAdapterCreate` callback from the code snippet above to the code snippet below.

```typescript
const afterCallAdapterCreate = useCallback(async (adapter: CallAdapter) => {
  adapter.on('transferRequested', (e) => {
    e.accept({
      audioOptions: { muted: true },
      videoOptions: { localVideoStreams: undefined }
    });
  });
  return adapter;
}, []);
```

Here is another example of using a dialog to prompt the user to accept or reject transfer requests.

## Requesting transfers

ACS users cannot request transfers yet.
