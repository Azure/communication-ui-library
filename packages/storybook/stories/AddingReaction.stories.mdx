# Adding Reaction to your Meeting Experiences

The web is a quiet place and communication experiences are not. This concept is about creating a more rich communication experience by providing event driven reaction to your communication experiences.

## Meeting Reaction

This feature is designed to empower developers by enabling them to integrate the ability to send or receive reactions into their calling experiences.
While the web environment is generally quiet, calling experiences tend to be more dynamic. There are various calling or meeting scenarios in which we aim to add reaction experience
throughout the call's lifecycle to offer users real-time feedback about ongoing events. These include:

<ul>
  <li>
    In an ongoing meeting or call - User expressing their support, approval, funny emotion, love, surprise emotion or
    appreciation to an ongoing topic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meeting where admin restricts a particular set of users to talk or turn their video on - send reaction or seeing
    reaction is the only mode of communication in a larger audience to interact with everyone without interrupting
    ongoing presentation.
  </li>
</ul>

It is important to note that as the developer you will need to ensure that your sprite animation image files are loaded or bundled appropriately in your project.
Recommended reading for this is found here with these common bundlers:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-images">webpack</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/">create-react-app</a>
  </li>
</ul>

We are providing the meeting reaction experiences on our `CallComposite` and `CallWithChatComposite`. The reaction resources are
applied through the `CallAdapter` options and reactions can be added to the experience with the following snippet.
