# Accessibility

Accessibility by design is a principle across Microsoft products.
UI Library follows this principle in making sure that all UI Components are fully accessible.
During public preview, the UI Library will continue to improve and add accessibility feature to the UI Components.
We expect to add more details on accessibility ahead of the UI Library being in General Availability.
