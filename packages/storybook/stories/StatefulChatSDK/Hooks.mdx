# Hooks

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) allows developers to use state and other react features without writing a class component.

While you can choose any state management library such as Redux, we also provide a simple way to power react components with our Stateful SDK. We provide two [customer hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) in our library([usePropsFor()](#usePropsFor), [useSelector()](#useSelector)), they allow you subscribe to changes in the SDK state and get right hanlders for our UI components.

## Before you start

Before you start, you need to wrap your whole App with Providers. They allow you access to global variables (like Stateful ChatClient/CallClient) for our hooks to consume. There are different Providers for building apps with varying functionality:

### Chat

For Chat Contoso app, ChatClientProvider and ChatThreadClientProvider are providers allowing hooks to access to ChatClient and ChatThreadClient. StatefulClient instances need to be provided to Provider when you wrap your app, check [ChatSDKIntroduction]() to see how to create them.

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <ChatClientProvider chatClient={statefulChatClient}>
    <ChatThreadClientProvider chatThreaClient={statefulChatThreadClient}>
      <App />
    <ChatThreadClientProvider>
  </ChatClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Calling

TBD

## usePropsFor()

```tsx
const result: any = usePropsFor(component: React.FunctionalComponent);
```

If you are using React Component from our communication-react components, usePropsFor is the go-to hook. It provides all the required props to power a feature component. It subscribes to state changes of stateful clients, get props designed for your component, and triggered new re-render whenever the props change.

Check [feature component list]() for supported components.

### _usePropsFor_ Example <a name="usePropsFor"></a>

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { MessageThread } from '@azure/acs-chat-component';
import { useSelector } from '@azure/acs-chat-selector';

export const ChatScreen = () => {
  const props = usePropsFor(MessageThread);
  return <MessageThread {...props} />;
};
```

### Under the hood of usePropsFor()

usePropsFor() is a function provides all you need to run component in our library. It combines 2 hooks(in following sections) and generate right props for you.

1. Find the right selector designed for the component, then call useSelector()
2. Construct a set of handlers tailored for the component

## useSelector()

```ts
const props: any = useSelector(selector: (state, props) => any, selectorProps: any);
```

useSelector allows you to provide your own [selector]() function and get your own props for components from our stateful SDK. It subscribes to state changes and run selector every time when anything changes in the state, but note that it will only trigger component re-render when return value of selector changes.

### When to call useSelector() <a name="useSelector"></a>

By default, if you are satisfied with props we prepared for component library, all you need is to call usePropsFor() to power our component. But sometimes you might want to call use selector instead when:

1. Override the way how it generates props from state
2. Write your own components (which we don't provide dedicated selectors for it)

### Basic Example:

```tsx
const chatInfoSelector = (state) => ({
  id: state.userId
  userName: state.displayName
});

const chatInfoProps = useSelector(userIdSelector);

const ChatInfo = ({id: string, userName: string}) => {
  return <div> userName: {userName}, id: {id} </div>;
}

<ChatInfo {...chatInfoProps} />
```

### Memoizing your selector (Recommended for optimized perf)

While this Basic Example will work without problem, but it is not a good way to optimize your app perf, it is recommended to use reselect library to enable memoization for selector to get better performance, check [reselect official docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSelector#createselector) for more information:

```tsx
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const chatInfoSelector = createSelector([(state) => state.userId, (state) => state.displayName], (id, userName) => ({
  id,
  userName
}));

const chatInfoProps = useSelector(userIdSelector);

const ChatInfo = ({ id: string, userName: string }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {' '}
      userName: {userName}, id: {id}{' '}
    </div>
  );
};

<ChatInfo {...chatInfoProps} />;
```

## Override default behaviors

While we provide a set of default props(which includes data and handler functions) for our UI library component, you might find it does not fit all you needs, there are several different ways you can choose to override the default behavior.

### Write your own handler function

Under some situations, you may want to throw default behavior away and write your own api call (like send your own api calls to another service, or call another api in our stateful SDK). You can entirely override the handler with your own behavior, we provide an example of how to call a stateful client instead of using default handler(which still ends up with the same behavior)

```tsx
const sendBoxProps = usePropsFor(SendBox);
// This hook will get stateful client you created
const chatThreadClient = useChatThreadClient();

const onMessageSend = useCallback(
  (message: string) => {
    const sendMessageRequest = {
      content,
      senderDisplayName: chatClient.state.displayName
    };
    // directly call into stateful client
    await chatThreadClient.sendMessage(sendMessageRequest);
  },
  [chatThreadClient]
);

<SendBox {...sendBoxProps} onMessageSend={onMessageSend} />;
```

### Override selector

With hooks we provide, it is also possible to override selector without re-writing default handlers

```tsx
const customSelector = createSelector(....); // create your own selector
const messageThreadProps = useSelector(customSelector);
const messageThreadHandlers = useHandlers(MessageThread);


<MessageThread {...messageThreadProps} {...messageThreadHandlers} />
```

### Choose your own overridden combination

By calling useSelector/usePropsFor, you can get the right combination of default selector + overrided handler/default handler + overrided selector for your own needs. You can even entirely override the whole behavior by writing your own handler and selectors:

```tsx
const customSelector = createSelector(....); // create your own selector
const messageThreadProps = useSelector(customSelector);
// This hook will get stateful client you created
const chatThreadClient = useChatThreadClient();

// Create your own handlers
const onMessageSeen = useCallback((message: string) => {
  await chatThreadClient.sendReadReceipt({ chatMessageId });
}, [chatThreadClient]);

<MessageThread {...messageThreadProps} onMessageSeen={onMessageSeen} />
```
