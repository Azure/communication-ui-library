# Inbound Calling

Azure Communication Services UI Library is adding support for Inbound Calling. With this new feature, users will
be able to see and monitor new incoming calls when signed in to ACS or Teams as a Communication as a Teams User.
Users will be able to Accept with Audio, Accept with video, and reject incoming calls.

Enabling this feature will allow them see multiple incoming calls allowing the user to service multiple people
at once best supporting the people that want to get in touch. In any scenario when your user’s are logged in you
are able to Accept or reject calls based on your user’s needs.

## Incorporating Inbound Calling into your Experience

Currently the UI library exports a series of components like the [Video
Gallery](./?path=/docs/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery) or
[CallControls](./?path=/docs/ui-components-controlbar--control-bar) that allow you to build a Video calling
experience that you can join through our [stateful client](./?path=/docs/quickstarts-statefulcallclient--page).
With the introduction of these components we are also allowing you to attach to your experience a way to have
the calls come to you through these new react components. We are adding this capability with the new
`IncomingCallStack` and `IncomingCallNotification` Component. These new components will allow you to accept,
accept with video, or reject the call. Accepting will bring you straight into the call.
