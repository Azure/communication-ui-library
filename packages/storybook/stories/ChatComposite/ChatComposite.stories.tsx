      <Title>ChatComposite</Title>
      <Description>
        ChatComposite brings together key components to provide a full chat experience out of the box.
      </Description>
      <Heading>Basic usage</Heading>
      <Description>
        There are two parts to the composite - a `ChatComposite` react component and a `ChatAdapter` that connects the
        react component to the backend APIs.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        The key thing to note is that initialization of `ChatAdapter` is asynchronous. Thus, the initialization step
        requires special handling, as the example code below shows.

      <Heading>Prerequisites</Heading>
      <Description>
        ChatComposite provides the UI for an *existing user* in an *existing thread*. Thus, the user and thread must be
        created beforehand. Typically, the user and thread are created on a Contoso-owned service, and the `ChatConfig`
        is served to the client app that then passes it to the ChatComposite.

      <Heading>Theming</Heading>
      <Description>
        ChatComposite can be themed with Fluent UI themes, just like the base components. Look at the [ChatComposite
        themes canvas](./?path=/story/composites-chat--themes-canvas) to see theming in action or the [overall theming
        example](./?path=/docs/examples-themes--teams-theme-component) to see how theming works for all the components
        in this UI library.
