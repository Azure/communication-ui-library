# Quickstart: Get started with Stateful Clients

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the UI Toolkit to quickly integrate communication experiences into your applications.
In this quickstart, you'll learn how to integrate UI Toolkit stateful clients into your application to build communication experiences.
To learn more about how to build applications with UI Toolkit UI Components, see [Get started with UI Components](/?path=/docs/quickstarts-get-started-with-ui-components--page)
Stateful clients make it easier for developers to build UI applications on top of Azure Communication Services by providing built-in state that UI components can use to render. Find more information about [Stateful client here.](/?path=/docs/stateful-chat-client-introduction--page).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 12 Recommended).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp).
- Knowledge of [UI Toolkit Components](/?path=/story/quickstarts-get-started-with-ui-components--page). We will be using the UI Components in this quickstart.
- Knowledge of Azure Communication Services [Chat patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/chat/concepts). You will need to create a thread and a user to that thread to use the UI Toolkit. Look at the [recommended architecture for the UI Toolkit](/?path=/docs/use-cases--page#recommended-architecture)

## Setting up

UI Toolkit requires a React environment to be setup as described below. If you already have a React App, you can skip this section.

### Set Up React App

We'll use the `create-react-app` template for this quickstart. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

# Build app in typescript:
npx create-react-app ui-toolkit-starting-with-stateful --template typescript

cd ui-toolkit-quickstart

```

At the end of this process, you should have a full application inside the folder `ui-toolkit-starting-with-stateful`.
For this quickstart, we'll be modifying files inside the `src` folder.

### Install the package

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Toolkit for JavaScript.
Move the provided tarball (Private Preview) over to the `ui-toolkit-starting-with-stateful` directory. **Make sure to run the `npm i` command inside the `ui-toolkit-starting-with-stateful` directory.**

```bash

# For Private Preview install tarball
npm install --save ./{path for tarball}

```

The `--save` option lists the library as a dependency in your **package.json** file.

### Run Create React App

Let's test the Create React App installation by running:

```bash

npm run start

```

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces from the Azure Communication Services UI client library are referenced in this quickstart:

| Name                                                                                                                            | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ChatClient](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-communication-chat/1.0.0/classes/chatclient.html) | Low-level chat library client.                                                                       |

| [chatThreadSelector](/?path=/story/stateful-chat-client-introduction--page)                                                     | Method for generating reactive read-only props for Chat Thread UI Component from Stateful Client     |
| [sendBoxSelector](/?path=/story/stateful-chat-client-introduction--page)                                                        | Method to generate props for Send Box UI Component from Stateful Client                              |

## Compose Chat Components

For Chat, we will use the [`MessageThread`](/?path=/docs/ui-components-chatthread--chat-thread-component) and [`SendBox`](/?path=/docs/ui-components-sendbox--send-box-story-book-component) components.
To start add the code below to `App.tsx`.
For more information on getting started with UI Components follow the [quickstart](/?path=/story/quickstarts-get-started-with-ui-components--page)

`App.tsx`

<Source code={ChatApp} />

## Instantiate Stateful Chat client in the app

Update the `App.tsx` file to create a `statefulChatClient` off the low-level `ChatClient` using the method `chatClientDeclaratify`.
Make sure to populate the constants at the top of the App code with information from your Azure Communication Services Resource.
These properties will be used to instantiate the `ChatClient` and `statefulChatClient`. Review [Chat patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/chat/concepts) for questions on these properties.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={ChatAppStateful} />

## Generate selector props to UI Components

Update the `App.tsx` file to generate selector props off the `statefulChatClient`.
`statefulChatClient` will be updated asynchronously repeatedly in response to user actions and notifications from the chat server. We mirror these changes into the generated props via `useEffect`.
The selector props needs to be updated everytime the `statefulChatClient` state changes to make sure they keep up to date.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={ChatAppStateful} />

## Generate handler props to UI Components

Update the `App.tsx` file to generate handler props off the `statefulChatClient`.
Handlers will update the `statefulChatClient` whenever the UI Components generate an event such as send a message.
Update the UI Components to also use handlers as props.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={ChatAppHandlers} />

## Run quickstart

At this point your app should have two UI Components hooked up to
To run the code above use the command:

```console

npm run start

```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group.
Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
Learn more about [cleaning up resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#clean-up-resources).
