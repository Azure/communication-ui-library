# Quickstart: Get started with Call Stateful Client

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the UI Library to quickly integrate communication experiences into your applications.
In this quickstart, you'll learn how to integrate UI Library stateful clients into your application to build communication experiences.
To learn more about how to build applications with UI Library UI Components, see [Get started with UI Components](./?path=/docs/quickstarts-uicomponents--page)
Stateful clients make it easier for developers to build UI applications on top of Azure Communication Services by providing built-in state that UI components can use to render.
Find more information about [Stateful client here.](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-overview--page).

## Download the code

You can find the completed code for this quickstart here: [Get started with Call Stateful Client](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/ui-library-starting-with-calling-stateful)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 12 Recommended).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp).
- An identity with Call scope. Generate an identity using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).

**Recommended:**

- Knowledge of [UI Library Components](./?path=/story/quickstarts-uicomponents--page). We will be using the UI Components in this quickstart.
- Knowledge of Azure Communication Services [Call Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/about-call-types).

## Generate Access Token

For setting up adapters that power the composites, we need to generate an access token to allow the adapters to interact with the Azure Communication Services back-end.

Access Tokens can be generated using this [Azure Portal quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity) inside your Azure Communication Services dashboard as shown below.

## Setting Up

UI Library requires a React environment to be setup as described below. If you already have a React App, you can skip this section.

### Set Up React App

We'll use the `create-react-app` template for this quickstart. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

npx create-react-app ui-library-starting-with-call-stateful --template typescript

cd ui-library-starting-with-call-stateful

```

At the end of this process, you should have a full application inside the folder `ui-library-starting-with-call-stateful`.
For this quickstart, we'll be modifying files inside the `src` folder.

### Install the Package

Use the `npm install` command to install the `@azure/communication-react` library.

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-react

```

**Beta-channel setup**

`@azure/communication-react` is in the process of migrating the core Azure Communication Services dependencies to `peerDependencies` so that
you can most consistently use the API from the core libraries in your application.

If you are using a beta package (has a `beta` suffix) >= `@azure/communication-react@1.0.1-beta.2`, you need to install
the low-level client libraries as well:

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.3.2-beta.1
npm install @azure/communication-chat@1.1.0

```

### Run Create React App

Let's test the Create React App installation by running:

```bash

npm run start

```

At this stage you should see a browser tab open with the default state of the create react app.

## Object Model

The following classes and interfaces from the Azure Communication Services UI client library are referenced in this quickstart:

| Name                                                                                                                                                              | Description                                                                            |

## Instantiate Stateful Call Client, Call Agent and Call

Update the `App.tsx` file to create a `statefulCallClient` off the low-level `CallClient` using the method `createStatefulCallClient`.
Make sure to populate the constants at the top of the App code with information from your Azure Communication Services Resource.
These properties will be used to instantiate the `CallClient`, `CallAgent` and `Call`.

As part of the constants that need to be populated is the `groupId` which is a GUID generated by the developer.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={CallAppStateful} />

## Add Providers

Next we will add four providers that will encapsulate our UI components.

1. The `FluentThemeProvider` which provides visual theme to the underlying components.
2. The `CallClientProvider` which provides state from the `statefulCallClient` to the components.
   For this provider, we will pass the `statefulCallClient` as a prop to the provider.
3. The `CallAgentProvider` which provides state from the `CallAgent` to the components.
   For this provider, we will pass the `CallAgent` as a prop to the provider.
4. we will add the 'CallProvider' which provides the `Call` objects state down to the components.
   For this provider, we will pass the `Call` as a prop to the provider.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={CallAppStatefulProviders} />

## Compose Call Components

Now that we have our structure ready, we will now create our call experience using UI Components.
For Call, we will use the [VideoGallery](./?path=/story/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery) and [ControlBar](./?path=/story/ui-components-controlbar--control-bar) components.
To start add the code below to a new file `CallComponentsStateful.tsx`.
For more information on getting started with UI Components follow the [quickstart](./?path=/story/quickstarts-uicomponents--page)
Here we will use the `usePropsFor` hook to connect our components to the stateful clients.
The `usePropsFor` method takes in the component for which we want props generated, in this case `VideoGallery` and `ControlBar`.

`CallComponentsStateful.tsx`

<Source code={CallComponentsStateful} />

Similarly to how we used `usePropsFor` with chat UI Components, it can be used for calling UI Components.
For more information on [usePropsFor](./?path=/story/statefulclient-reacthooks-usepropsfor--page).

## Add Components to App

Now that we have configured our providers and the call components we can put them together.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={CallAppStatefulComplete} />

## Run Quickstart

At this point your app should have two UI Components hooked up to
To run the code above use the command:

```console

npm run start

```

## Troubleshooting

See the [troubleshooting page](./?path=/story/troubleshooting--page) for some common problems and recommended solutions.

## Clean Up Resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group.
Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
Learn more about [cleaning up resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#clean-up-resources).
