# Quickstart: Get started with UI Components

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the UI Library to quickly integrate communication experiences into your applications. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to integrate UI Library base components into your application to build communication experiences.

UI Library components come in two flavors: UI and Composite.

- **UI components** represent discrete communication capabilities; they're the basic building blocks that can be used to build complex communication experiences.
- **Composite components** are turn-key experiences for common communication scenarios that have been built using **base components** as building blocks and packaged to be easily integrated into applications.

## Download the code

You can find the completed code for this quickstart here: [Get started with UI Components](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/ui-library-quickstart-ui-components)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 16.19.0 and above).

## Setting Up

UI Library requires a React environment to be setup. Next we will do that. If you are creating a new app or are
having issues since your app is running react 18 or higher visit our [setup page](./?path=/docs/setup-communication-react--page).

### Install the Package

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Library for JavaScript.

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-react

```

`@azure/communication-react` specifies core Azure Communication Services as `peerDependencies` so that
you can most consistently use the API from the core libraries in your application. You need to install those libraries as well:

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.4.4
npm install @azure/communication-chat@1.2.0

```

### Run Create React App

Let's test the Create React App installation by running:

```bash

npm run start

```

## Object Model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services UI client library:

| Name                                                                        | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [FluentThemeProvider](./?path=/story/theming--page)                         | Provider that controls Theming on the components. Can be used to override theme          |
| [GridLayout](./?path=/story/ui-components-gridlayout--grid-layout)          | Base component that organizes video tiles into a grid                                    |
| [VideoTile](./?path=/story/ui-components-videotile--video-tile)             | Base component to render participants either with or without video                       |
| [ControlBar](./?path=/story/ui-components-controlbar--control-bar)          | Base component to control call including mute, video, share screen                       |
| [MessageThread](./?path=/story/ui-components-messagethread--message-thread) | Base component that renders a chat thread with typing indicators, read receipts, etc.    |
| [SendBox](./?path=/story/ui-components-sendbox--send-box)                   | Base component that allows user to input messages that will be sent to the joined thread |

## Set Up Fluent Theme Provider and Icons

The `FluentThemeProvider` is a required wrapper around the UI Library components to provide theming that makes the components look amazing!
It is in charge of allowing developer customize the theme of the components as well. Check out [Theming](./?path=/story/theming--page) for more information. `FluentThemeProvider` defaults to using light theme.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={AppText} />

Inside the `FluentThemeProvider`, you can add additional components.
Next we'll use various UI components to showcase a sample experience.
You can customize the layout of these components and add any other custom components that you want to render with them.

## Calling UI Components

For Calling, we'll use the [`GridLayout`](./?path=/story/ui-components-gridlayout--grid-layout) and [`ControlBar`](./?path=/story/ui-components-controlbar--control-bar) components.
To start, in the `src` folder, create a new file called `CallingComponents.tsx`.
Here we'll initialize a function component that will hold our base components to then import in `App.tsx`.
You can add extra layout and styling around the components.

`CallingComponents.tsx`

<Source code={CallingComponentsText} />

For this example, we added one [`VideoTile`](./?path=/story/ui-components-videotile--video-tile) to the grid, but more can be added.

## Chat UI Components

For Chat, we will use the [`MessageThread`](./?path=/story/ui-components-messagethread--message-thread) and [`SendBox`](./?path=/story/ui-components-sendbox--send-box) components.
To start, in the `src` folder, create a new file called `ChatComponents.tsx`.
Here we'll initialize a function component that will hold our base components to then import in `App.tsx`.

`ChatComponents.tsx`

<Source code={ChatComponentsText} />

## Add Calling and Chat Components

Back in the `App.tsx` file, we will now add the components to the `FluentThemeProvider` like shown below.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={CompletedComponentsAppText} />
<Canvas withSource="none">
  <CompletedComponentsApp />
</Canvas>

## Run Quickstart

To run the code above use the command:

```console

npm run start

```

## Troubleshooting

See the [troubleshooting page](./?path=/story/troubleshooting--page) for some common problems and recommended solutions.

## Clean Up Resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group.
Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
Learn more about [cleaning up resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#clean-up-resources).
