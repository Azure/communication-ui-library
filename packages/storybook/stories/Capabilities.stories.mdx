# Capabilities

## Overview

Capabilities are actions that ACS users can perform during a call are controlled based on their role. Capabilites are only
present in certain types of calls like the Teams interop scenario.

The capabilities of an ACS user are reflected in the Call and CallWithChat composites by disabling controls and notifications.
For example, if the ACS user loses the capability to turn their video on and share their screen then this will be reflected in
the call composite like shown in the screenshot below.

Currently, the only capabilities that are reflected in the Teams interop scenario are:

- unmuting microphone
- turning on video
- sharing screen

For the Teams interop scenario, user roles and capabilities can be configured in Teams by the meeting organizer through
'Meeting options' like the screenshot below.

A Rooms call also has roles for ACS users which define their capabilities. The Rooms call feature is supported in beta
version **1.3.2-beta.1** or later. To learn more about Rooms calls and the different roles within click
[here](path=/docs/rooms).

## Teams policies

Teams policies can be assigned to Teams users which include defining the capabilities of the assigned Teams users within
a tenant. To learn more about Teams policies click
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/assign-policies-users-and-groups). It is important to note that
Teams policies cannot be applied to ACS users so their capabilities are not affected by Teams policies.

Teams policies do, however, affect Teams users who use ACS to join a Teams meeting also known as CTE users. CTE is
supported in beta version **1.5.1-beta.1** or later. For more on CTE users, click
[here](path=/docs/communicationasteamsuser--page). Currently, the only capability affected by Teams policies for CTE
users in Teams meetings is share screen.

## Listening to changes in capabilities

The CallAdapter and CallWithChatAdapter allow you to listen to 'capabilitiesChanged' events by defining your own
`CapabilitiesChangedListener` callback. The following code snippet shows an example of the CallAdapter using a
`CapabilitiesChangedListener` to simply log the capabilities changed information to the browser console.

It is important to note using the `CapabilitiesChangedListener` callback will not override the behavior of the Call and
CallWithChat composite that handles enabling/disabling controls and show notifications based on the capabilities
changed.
