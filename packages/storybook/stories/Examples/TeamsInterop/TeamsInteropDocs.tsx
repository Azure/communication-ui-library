      <Description>Microsoft Teams allows users to share images by:</Description>
      <Description>- Copying & paste into the box at the bottom of the chat.</Description>
      <Description>- Drag & drop into the chat area.</Description>
      <Description>- Upload an image as a file via the "Upload from this device" button.</Description>
      <Description>
        Azure Communication Services currently support only option one for copying and pasting the image. Users can
        achieve it using keyboard shortcuts or the operating system's context menu options for copy and paste.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Certain GIF encodings may not be supported by the UI library at this time, the user might receive a static image
        instead and this is a known issue. To learn more about currently supported UI library use cases, please refer to
        the [UI Library use
        cases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/ui-library/ui-library-use-cases?pivots=platform-web#chat-use-cases).

      <Subheading>Use CallWithChat Composite with Inline Image Support</Subheading>
      <Description>
        Currently, the UI library only supports inline images in a Teams Interop chat sent by the Teams user. To
        lerverage this feature, you can use the `CallWithChat` composite.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Try out the `CallWithChat` composite in the [CallWithChatComposite Basic
        Example](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-basicexample--basic-example).
      </Description>
      <Subheading>Use MessageThread component with Inline Image Support</Subheading>
      <Description>
        `MessageThread` is designed to be responsive and supports inline images natively. To achieve this, you need to
        simply pass in chat messages in HTML format with `img` tag embedded to `MessageThread` component without any
        additional setup.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Moreover, If you need the UI library to render images that requires authentications, you can refer to the
        following code snippet on how to render a chat message with protected inline images and where you can provide a
        custom authentication logic for the UI library to fetch and render images.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        Noticing in the `img` tag, the `id` attribute contains the same id as defined in the array
        `attachedFilesMetadata`. The is used by the UI library to locate the image and replace its `src` to local path
        of the blob image. In addition, the `attachmentType` of each `FileMetadata` is set to `teamsInlineImage` of
        `FileMetadataAttachmentType`.
