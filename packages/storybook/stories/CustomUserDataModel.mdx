# Custom User Data Model

Azure Communication Services uses an identity agnostic model where developers can bring their own identities.
This translates to developers having their own user data models that are linked to the Azure Communication Services identities.
As part of their own data models, developers might have information about a user such as their display name, profile picture or avatar and other details.
The UI Library makes it simple for developers to inject those user data models into the UI Components, so that when rendered they show a users provided information rather than generic information that Azure Communication Services has.
UI Library enables these capabilities for both UI Components and Composites. In the document we will introduce the patterns to customize user data models for both types of components.

## UI Component 

For UI Components, user data models can be customized for each individual component.
This provides developers the most flexibility when building truly custom experiences that might expose and reflect different parts of a users persona.
User data model injection is available for those components that expose user information particularly their display name and their avatar.
Below you will find a table with the components that support injection and the pattern/method used to inject information.

| UI Components      | Display Name    | Avatar              |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [Video Tile](/?path=/story/ui-components-video-tile--video-tile)       | avatarName      | placeholderProvider |
| [Message Thread](/?path=/story/ui-components-message-thread--message-thread)   | OnMessageRender | onRenderAvatar      |
| [Typing Indicator](/?path=/story/ui-components-typing-indicator--typing-indicator) | onRenderUsers   | onRenderUsers       |
| [Participant Item](/?path=/story/ui-components-participant-item--participant-item) | name            | onRenderAvatar      |

Additional examples on how this user data model injection pattern works, visit the individual component pages for each component.

## Composites

For Composites, used data models can be customzied at a composite level.
As turn-key experience, developers can provide a single data model mapping to the composite and the composite takes care of rendering the correct information for a user.
Composites support user data model injection for display name and avatar across both chat and calling composites.

| Composite          | Display Name    | Avatar              |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [Group Calling](/?path=/story/composites-group-call--group-call)       | TBD | TBD |
| [Group Chat](/?path=/story/composites-group-chat--group-chat)  | TBD | TBD |
