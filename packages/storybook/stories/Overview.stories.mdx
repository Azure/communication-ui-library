**Azure Communication Services UI Library** makes it easy for you to build visual communications experiences.

Building these experiences can be challenging.
There are a lot of moving pieces including dynamic remote video galleries, local user controls, rendering incoming chat messages, etc.
On top of that developers must worry about accessibility and localization for this experiences.
**UI Library** is here to help!

If you just want an out of the box communications experiences that you can drop into your application, we offer **Composites**.
It takes only a couple lines of code to add and configure.

In some cases, you might additional customization and control over the overall communication experiences, for that we offer **UI Components**.
These components can be composed together to build calling and chat experiences. For example, a [Video Gallery](./?path=/story/ui-components-videotile--video-tile) or a [Message Thread](./?path=/story/ui-components-messagethread--message-thread).

These UI client libraries all use [Microsoft's Fluent design language](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui/) and assets. Fluent UI provides a foundational layer for the UI Library and is actively used across Microsoft products.

The UI Library for Azure Communication Services delivers on the Microsoft promise of diversity and inclusion.
All the UI Library components are fully accessible based on Microsoft [accessibility](./?path=/docs/accessibility--page) guidelines.
They provide full [localization](./?path=/docs/localization--page) to enable developers to tweak them to their target audience.

## Installing UI Library

```bash
npm i @azure/communication-react
```

## Composites Overview

Composites are higher-level components composed of UI components that deliver turn-key solutions for common communication scenarios using Azure Communication Services.
Developers can easily instantiate the Composite using an Azure Communication Services access token and the required configuration attributed for call or chat.

### Call composite

[CallComposite](./?path=/story/composites-call-basicexample--basic-example) is providing a calling experience that allows users to start or join a call. Inside the experience users can configure their
devices, participate in the call with video and see other participants, including those with video turn on.

Here are visual examples of Call composite where participants have their camera turned off, then some ahve them turned on.
People speaking with microphone unmuted will have their tile appearing with a blue border.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '2rem' }} style={overviewPageImagesStackStyle}>
  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_CamerasOff.png"
      alt="Call composite where all participants have their camera turned off"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_CamerasOn.png"
      alt="Call composite where some participants have their camera turned on"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
</Stack>

When joining a Microsoft Teams call ([Teams Interop experience](./?path=/docs/examples-teamsinterop-compliancebanner--compliance-banner)), the
Call Composite includes a lobby experience where the user is waiting to be admitted into the call.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '3rem' }} style={overviewPageImagesStackStyle}>
  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_TeamsInterop_WaitingLobby.png"
      alt="Call composite waiting to be admitted in a Teams meeting"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
  <Stack.Item align="center" tokens={{ childrenGap: '2rem' }}>
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{'Popup appearing in Teams to admit ACS participant'}</p>
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_TeamsInterop_AdmissionFromTeams.png"
      alt="Popup in Teams to admit ACS participants"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
</Stack>

### Chat composite

[ChatComposite](./?path=/story/composites-chat-basicexample--basic-example) is providing a chat experience where user can send and receive
messages. Message thread events such as typing indicators, whether the message has been successfully delivered or read, or participants entering
and leaving the chat are displayed to the user as part of the chat thread.

Here is a visual example of Chat composite.

<Stack style={overviewPageImagesStackStyle}>

## UI Component Overview

Pure UI Components that can be used by developers to compose communication experiences, from stitching video tiles into a grid to showcase remote participants, to organizing components to fit your applications specifications.
UI Components support customization to give the components the right feel and look to match an applications branding and style.

Following are lists of components that can be used for specific areas.

### Main Components for Calling

## What UI Artifact is Best for my Project?

Understanding these requirements will help you choose the right client library:

- **How much customization do you desire?** Azure Communication core client libraries don't have a UX and are designed so you can build whatever UX you want. UI Library components provide UI assets at the cost of reduced customization.
- **What platforms are you targeting?** Different platforms have different capabilities.

Details about feature availability in the [UI Library is available here](./?path=/story/usecases--page), but key trade-offs are summarized below.
