Azure Communication Services - UI Library makes it easy for you to build modern communications user experiences using Azure Communication Services.
It gives you a library of production-ready UI components that you can drop into your applications:

- **Composites** - These components are turn-key solutions that implement common communication scenarios.
  You can quickly add video calling or chat experiences to your applications.
  Composites are open-source higher order components built using UI components.

- **UI Components** - These components are open-source building blocks that let you build custom communications experience.
  Components are offered for both calling and chat capabilities that can be combined to build experiences.

These UI client libraries all use [Microsoft's Fluent design language](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui/) and assets. Fluent UI provides a foundational layer for the UI Library and is actively used across Microsoft products.

In conjunction to the UI components, the UI Library exposes a _stateful client library_ for calling and chat.
This client is agnostic to any specific state management framework and can be integrated with common state managers like Redux or React Context.
This stateful client library can be used with the UI Components to pass props and methods for the UI Components to render data.
For more information, see [Stateful Client Overview](./?path=/story/statefulclient-overview--page).

## Installing UI Library

```bash
npm i --save @azure/communication-react
```

## Composites Overview

Composites are higher-level components composed of UI components that deliver turn-key solutions for common communication scenarios using Azure Communication Services.
Developers can easily instantiate the Composite using an Azure Communication Services access token and the required configuration attributed for call or chat.

### Call composite

[CallComposite](./?path=/story/composites-call-basicexample--basic-example) is providing a calling experience that allows users to start or join a call. Inside the experience users can configure their
devices, participate in the call with video and see other participants, including those with video turn on.

Here are visual examples of Call composite where participants have their camera turned off, then some ahve them turned on.
People speaking with microphone unmuted will have their tile appearing with a blue border.

  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_CamerasOff.png"
      alt="Call composite where all participants have their camera turned off"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_CamerasOn.png"
      alt="Call composite where some participants have their camera turned on"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
</Stack>

When joining a Microsoft Teams call ([Teams Interop experience](./?path=/docs/examples-teamsinterop-compliancebanner--compliance-banner)), the
Call Composite includes a lobby experience where the user is waiting to be admitted into the call.

<Stack horizontal horizontalAlign="space-between" tokens={{ childrenGap: '3rem' }} style={overviewPageImagesStackStyle}>
  <Stack.Item align="center">
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_TeamsInterop_WaitingLobby.png"
      alt="Call composite waiting to be admitted in a Teams meeting"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
  <Stack.Item align="center" tokens={{ childrenGap: '2rem' }}>
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{'Popup appearing in Teams to admit ACS participant'}</p>
    <img
      src="images/callComposite_TeamsInterop_AdmissionFromTeams.png"
      alt="Popup in Teams to admit ACS participants"
    />
  </Stack.Item>
</Stack>

### Chat composite

[ChatComposite](./?path=/story/composites-chat-basicexample--basic-example) is providing a chat experience where user can send and receive
messages. Message thread events such as typing indicators, whether the message has been successfully delivered or read, or participants entering
and leaving the chat are displayed to the user as part of the chat thread.

Here is a visual example of Chat composite.

## UI Component Overview

Pure UI Components that can be used by developers to compose communication experiences, from stitching video tiles into a grid to showcase remote participants, to organizing components to fit your applications specifications.
UI Components support customization to give the components the right feel and look to match an applications branding and style.

Following are lists of components that can be used for specific areas.

## What UI Artifact is Best for my Project?

Understanding these requirements will help you choose the right client library:

- **How much customization do you desire?** Azure Communication core client libraries don't have a UX and are designed so you can build whatever UX you want. UI Library components provide UI assets at the cost of reduced customization.
- **What platforms are you targeting?** Different platforms have different capabilities.

Details about feature availability in the [UI Library is available here](./?path=/story/usecases--page), but key trade-offs are summarized below.
