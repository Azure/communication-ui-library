## Hide Attendee Names

Microsoft Teams Meetings has introduced a Teams Premium meeting option called “Hide attendee names” which would mask the identity of attendees for other attendees in the meeting.
This feature is launching in Webinars and Meetings.
As a follow up, Microsoft Azure Communications Services has updated its UI library composites to include support for “hide attendee names”.
This feature will enable more optimized experience for large meetings and presentations and greater interoperability with Teams meetings.

**Incorporating Hide Attendee Names to your Meeting Experiences**
The UI Library enables users to enhance their video conferencing experiences by providing the hide attendee names feature by default within the CallComposite and CallWithChat experiences.

**Attendee View**
Attendees cannot see names and details of other attendees, but they will be able to see names and details of organizers co-organizers, and presenters.

  seen by organizers, co-organizers, and presenters. The names and details of organizers and presenters are visible to
  all participants.

  <br />
  No, the hide attendee names option cannot be changed during the meeting. The option is set by the organizer before the
  meeting starts.
