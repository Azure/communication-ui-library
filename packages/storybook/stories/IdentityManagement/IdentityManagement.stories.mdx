# Identity Management

Azure Communication Services is an [identity-agnostic service][doc-acs-identities].
Customers generate Azure Communication Services identities and tokens corresponding to their users via the identity
service. Interaction with Azure Communication Services identity service is a privileged operation. Customers should
deploy a secure backend service that interacts with the identity service and serves just the short-lived Azure
Communication Services identity tokens to the client application. These short-lived identity tokens are all that the
client application needs to interact with the Azure Communication Services like Chat and Calling.

[doc-acs-identities]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/identity-model

## Calling

Azure Communication Services Calling SDK requires a user identity, token and an identifier for the call to join.

A typical implementation of the backend service that mints the user token might look so:

<Source code={CallBackendText} />

The following utility canvas is backed by the same logic to mint tokens. You can use this to generate the data needed for
the [`CallComposite` stories in this storybook](/?path=/story/composites-call--basic-example).

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story story={stories.CallBackend} />
</Canvas>

## Chat

Azure Communication Services Chat SDK requires a user identity and token. Additionally, participants in a chat must be explicitly
added to the chat thread (Compare this to Calling SDK, where a participant may join a call using the group ID).

A typical implementation of the backend service that mints the user tokens and adds them to a chat thread might look so:

<Source code={ChatBackendText} />

The following utility canvas is backed by the same logic to mint tokens and create threads. You can use this to generate the
data needed for the [`ChatComposite` stories in this storybook](/?path=/docs/composites-chat--basic-example).

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story story={stories.ChatBackend} />
</Canvas>
