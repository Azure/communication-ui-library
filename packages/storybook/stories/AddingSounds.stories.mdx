# Adding Sounds to your Communication Experiences

The web is a quiet place and communication experiences are not. This concept is about creating a more rich communication experience by providing event driven sounds to your communication experiences.

## Calling sounds

<DetailedBetaBanner />

This feature is meant to allow developers to add sounds to their calling experiences. The web is a quiet place and
calling experiences are not. We have many situations where we want to play sounds in the lifecycle of a call to provide feedback to ther user
that something is happening. These include:

<ul>
  <li>Call Ringing - Call is outgoing to the callee</li>
  <li>Call Ended - Call ends because you or the callee ended the call</li>
  <li>Call Busy - Call is rejected by the callee because they are busy and unable to take the call</li>
</ul>

Its is important to note that as the developer you will need to ensure that your mp3 or other sound files are loaded or bundled appropriately in your project.
Recommended reading for this is found here with these common bundlers:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-images">webpack</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/">create-react-app</a>
  </li>
</ul>

We are providing these sound experiences on our `CallComposite` and `CallWithChatComposite`. These sounds are
applied through the `CallAdapter` options and sounds can be added to the experience with the following snippet.
