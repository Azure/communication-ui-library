# Inbound Calling

Azure Communication Services UI Library is adding support for Inbound Calling. With this new feature, users will
be able to see and monitor new incoming calls when signed in to Azure Communication Services or as a Teams User.
Users will be able to accept with audio, accept with video, and reject incoming calls.

Enabling this feature will allow them to see multiple incoming calls allowing the user to service multiple people
at once. In any scenario, when your users are logged in, you are able to connect with your customers in a more direct way.

## Incorporating Inbound Calling into your Experience

Currently the UI library exports a series of components like the [Video
Gallery](./?path=/docs/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery) or
[CallControls](./?path=/docs/ui-components-controlbar--control-bar) that allow you to build a Video calling
experience that you can join through our [stateful client](./?path=/docs/quickstarts-statefulcallclient--page).
With the introduction of these components, we are also allowing you to attach to your experience a way to have
the calls come to you through these new react components. We are adding this capability with the new
[IncomingCallStack](./?path=/docs/ui-components-internal-inboundcalling-incomingcallstack--incoming-call-stack) and
[IncomingCallNotification](./?path=/docs/ui-components-internal-inboundcalling-incomingcallnotification--incoming-call-notification) Component.
These new components will allow you to accept, accept with video, or reject the call. Accepting will bring you straight into the call.

The following code is a snippet of how you can incorporate the Inbound Calling feature into your experience:

<Source code={InboundCallingSource} />

**Note:** this code should be wrapped in our different stateful client providers to fetch state. See how to use our [`usePropsFor` react hook](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-reacthooks-usepropsfor--page).
