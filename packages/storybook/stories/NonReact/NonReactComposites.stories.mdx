# Use composites under non-react environment

If you are not using React, you can still embed a calling/chat composite into your html page with a simple `<script>` tag and several lines of code like:

```html
<script src="[url of chatComposite.js]"></script>
<!-- height need to be set for composite to fit the layout -->
<div id="chat-container" style="height: 50vh"></div>
<script>
  const chatAdapter = await chatComposite.loadChatComposite(
    {
      displayName: displayName,
      threadId: threadId,
      endpointUrl: endpointUrl,
      userId: user,
      token: token
    },
    document.getElementById('chat-container')
  );
</script>
```

Here's the step-by-step instruction to get the composite js bundle file:

### git clone our repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library.git
```

### install packages and build js bundles

```bash
cd communication-ui-library\samples\StaticHtmlComposites\
rush install
rush build
```

Then you will be able to see 2 js bundle files:

```
.\samples\StaticHtmlComposites\dist\chatComposite.js
.\samples\StaticHtmlComposites\dist\callComposite.js
```

There is also an example html for how to use it, you might want to allocate your own acs token before you embed the code piece to your own web app, check (Create and manage Communication Services resources)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp]:

```
.\samples\StaticHtmlComposites\index.html
```

### try it the sample

After finishing building the bundle, you can also try the sample

1. Replace the `ResourceConnectionString` in the `samples/Server/appsettings.json` file with the connection string from your Azure Communication Services resource, which is listed in the Azure Portal under _Keys_.

2. Run this command to start the server:

```bash
rushx start
```

3. Browse to http://localhost:3000
