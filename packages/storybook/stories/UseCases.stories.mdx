# UI Toolkit Use Cases

UI Toolkit supports a number of use cases across calling and chat experiences.
These capabilities are available through UI Components and Composites.
For Composites, these capabilities are built directly in and exposed when the composite is integrated into an application.
For UI Components, these capabilities are exposed through a combination of UI functionality and underlying stateful libraries.
To take full advantage of these capabilities we recommend using the UI Components in conjunction with the stateful call and chat client libraries.

## Supported identities:

An Azure Communication Services identity is required to initialize the stateful client libraries and authenticate to the service.
For more information on authentication, see [Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/authentication) and [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?pivots=programming-language-javascript)

## Customization

UI Toolkit exposes patterns for developers to modify components to fit the look and feel of their application.
This is a key area of differentiation between Composites and UI Components, where Composites provide less customization options in favor of a simpler integration experience.

| Use Case                                            | Composites | UI Components |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Fluent based Theming                                | X          | X             |
| Experience layout is composable                     |            | X             |
| CSS Styling can be used to modify style properties  |            | X             |
| Icons can be replaced                               |            | X             |
| Participant gallery layout can be modified          |            | X             |
| Call control layout can be modified                 | X          | X             |
| Data models can be injected to modify user metadata | X          | X             |

## Observability:

As part of the decoupled state management architecture of the UI Toolkit, developers are able to access the stateful calling and chat clients directly.
Developers can hook into the stateful client to read the state, handle events and override behavior to pass onto the UI Components.

| Use Case                                  | Composites | UI Components |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Call/Chat client state can be accessed    | X          | X             |
| Client events can be accessed and handled | X          | X             |
| UI events can be accessed and handled     | X          | X             |

## Recommended architecture

![UI Framework recommended architecture with client-server architecture](images/framework-architecture.png)

Composite and Base Components are initialized using an Azure Communication Services access token. Access tokens should be procured from Azure Communication Services through a
trusted service that you manage. See [Quickstart: Create Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?pivots=programming-language-javascript) and [Trusted Service Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/tutorials/trusted-service-tutorial) for more information.

These client libraries also require the context for the call or chat they will join. Similar to user access tokens, this context should be disseminated to clients via your own trusted service. The list below summarizes the initialization and resource management functions that you need to operationalize.

| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide access token from Azure                          | Pass through given access token to initialize components        |
| Provide refresh function                                 | Refresh access token using developer provided function          |
| Retrieve/Pass join information for call or chat          | Pass through call and chat information to initialize components |
| Retrieve/Pass user information for any custom data model | Pass through custom data model to components to render          |
