# UI Library Use Cases

UI Library supports many use cases across calling and chat experiences.
These capabilities are available through UI Components and Composites.
For Composites, these capabilities are built directly in and exposed when the composite is integrated into an application.
For UI Components, these capabilities are exposed through a combination of UI functionality and underlying stateful libraries.
To take full advantage of these capabilities, we recommend using the UI Components with the stateful call and chat client libraries.

## Chat Use Cases

| Area         | Use Cases                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |

| Participants | Participant roster                               |

## Supported Identities

An Azure Communication Services identity is required to initialize the stateful client libraries and authenticate to the service.
For more information on authentication, see [Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/authentication) and [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?pivots=programming-language-javascript)

## Teams Interop Use Case

For [Teams Interop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/teams-interop) scenarios, developers can use UI Library Components to join Teams meetings through Azure Communication Services.
To enable Teams Interop, developers can either use calling and chat composites directly or use UI Components to build a custom experience.
When enabling applications with both calling and chat, its important to remember that the chat client can't be initialized until the participant has been admitted to the call.
Once admitted, the chat client can be initialized to join the meeting chat thread.
See the diagram below for guidance:

![Teams Interop pattern for calling and chat](images/teams-interop-pattern.png)

When using UI Components to deliver Teams Interop experiences, UI Library provides examples for key pieces of the experience.
For example:

- [Lobby Example](./?path=/story/examples-teamsinterop-lobby--lobby): Sample lobby for participant to wait to be admitted to the call.
- [Compliance banner](./?path=/story/examples-teamsinterop-compliancebanner--compliance-banner): Sample banner to show the user whether the call is being recorded or not.
- [Teams Theme](./?path=/story/examples-themes-teams--teams): Sample theme that makes the UI Library looks like Microsoft Teams.

## Customization

UI Library exposes patterns for developers to modify components to fit the look and feel of their application.
These capabilities are a key area of differentiation between Composites and UI Components, where Composites provide less customization options in favor of a simpler integration experience.

| Use Case                                            | Composites | UI Components |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Fluent based Theming                                | ✔          | ✔             |
| Experience layout is composable                     |            | ✔             |
| CSS Styling can be used to modify style properties  |            | ✔             |
| Icons can be replaced                               |            | ✔             |
| Participant gallery layout can be modified          |            | ✔             |
| Call control layout can be modified                 | ✔          | ✔             |
| Data models can be injected to modify user metadata | ✔          | ✔             |

## Observability

As part of the decoupled state management architecture of the UI Library, developers are able to access the stateful calling and chat clients directly.
Developers can hook into the stateful client to read the state, handle events and override behavior to pass onto the UI Components.

| Use Case                                         | Composites | UI Components | Example                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call/Chat client state can be accessed           | ✔          | ✔             | Check whether a all is connected or see the participants in a thread         |
| Commands can be sent to the call and chat client | ✔          | ✔             | Mute or Unmute the call client or send messages on behalf of the user        |
| Client events can be accessed and handled        | ✔          | ✔             | Handle a participant join a call or intercept a message coming into a thread |
| UI events can be accessed and handled            | ✔          | ✔             | Handle mute button click or chat send button to add your own logic           |

## Recommended Architecture

![UI Library recommended architecture with client-server architecture](images/ui-library-architecture.png)

Composite and Base Components are initialized using an Azure Communication Services access token. Access tokens should be procured from Azure Communication Services through a
trusted service that you manage. See [Quickstart: Create Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?pivots=programming-language-javascript) and [Trusted Service Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/tutorials/trusted-service-tutorial) for more information.

These client libraries also require the context for the call or chat they will join. Similar to user access tokens, this context should be disseminated to clients via your own trusted service. The list below summarizes the initialization and resource management functions that you need to operationalize.

| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide access token from Azure                          | Pass through given access token to initialize components        |
| Provide refresh function                                 | Refresh access token using developer provided function          |
| Retrieve/Pass join information for call or chat          | Pass through call and chat information to initialize components |
| Retrieve/Pass user information for any custom data model | Pass through custom data model to components to render          |

## Platform support

| SDK              | Windows                       | macOS                         | Ubuntu   | Linux    | Android    | iOS          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ |

| UI SDK - Chat    | Firefox\*, Chrome\*, new Edge | Firefox\*, Chrome\*, Safari\* | Chrome\* | Chrome\* | Safari\*   |

\*Note that the latest version is supported in addition to the
previous two releases.

\*\*Note that outgoing screen sharing is not supported for Chrome on Android.

\*\*\*Note that Safari versions 13.1+ are supported. 1:1 calls are not supported on Safari. Outgoing video for Safari
macOS supported only for Safari 14+/macOS 11+. Outgoing screen sharing
is not supported on iOS, device selection(for example choosing Bluetooth headset) is limited by OS, only one device available.

## Accessibility

Accessibility by design is a principle across Microsoft products.
UI Library follows this principle in making sure that all UI Components are fully accessible.
During public preview, the UI Library will continue to improve and add accessibility feature to the UI Components.
We expect to add more details on accessibility ahead of the UI Library being in General Availability.

## Localization

Localization is a key to making products that can be used across the world and by people who who speak different languages.
UI Library will provide out of the box support for some languages and capabilities such as RTL.
Developers can provide their own localization files to be used for the UI Library.
These localization capabilities will be added ahead of General Availability.
