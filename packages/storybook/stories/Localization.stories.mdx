# Localization

Localization is a key to making products that can be used across the world and by people who who speak different languages.
UI Library will provide out of the box support for some languages and capabilities such as RTL.
Developers can provide their own localization files to be used for the UI Library.
These localization capabilities will be added ahead of General Availability.
