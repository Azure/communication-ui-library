# Localization

Localization is a key to making products that can be used across the world and by people who who speak different languages.
UI Library will provide out of the box support for some languages and capabilities such as RTL.
Developers can provide their own localization files to be used for the UI Library.

## LocalizationProvider

`LocalizationProvider` is a component wrapper that sets all the strings for UI Library components using a `Locale`. By default, all
components use our English (US) locale. If desired, LocalizationProvider can be used to set a different locale. Out of the box,
the UI library includes a set of locales usable with the UI components and composites

### Usage

To use the LocalizationProvider, import it from `@azure/communication-react` and wrap it around UI Library components. Then assign a `Locale` to the `locale` prop.
For the example below, we will localize buttons in a `ControlBar` in French (France) by also importing locale `fr_FR` from `@azure/communication-react`.

<Source code={LocalizationProviderSnippetText} />

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <LocalizationProviderSnippet />
</Canvas>

### Composites

If you want to localize your composite, assign a `Locale` to the `locale` prop of the composite. You may import one of our locales like `fr_FR` for French (France)
in the example below.

<Source code={LocalizedComposites} />

## Overriding locales

There are two options to customize the locales that we provide. For the examples below, let's say you wish to have a `ControlBar`
with strings from our English (US) locale but you want to change the label of `CameraButton` to "Start" when its state is off.

### Option 1: Import and customize locales

The first option is to import and customize locales. First, import `en_US` locale from `@azure/communication-react` and then reassign the
value `strings.cameraButton.offLabel` like shown below.

<Source code={CustomLocaleSnippetText} />

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <CustomLocaleSnippet />
</Canvas>

`Locale` stores all strings in the `strings` property as a nested object. The component name is the first identifer and the string key is
the second identifier such that each string can be accessed in this pattern `strings.<componentName>.<stringKey>`. If you are using
typescript and have intellisense available in your IDE, it will be easy to discover all the strings.

### Option 2: Override `strings` prop in the UI Component

The second option is to pass custom strings directly through the `strings` prop. Strings can be overriden for a UI Library
component through the optional `strings` property. There is no need to use `LocalizationProvider` because all
components default to English (US). Just assign the string directly through `CameraButton` like shown below.

<Source code={StringsPropertySnippetText} />

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <StringsPropertySnippet />
</Canvas>

We recommend using option 1 for localization for large applications with many components because all changes to the locale are made in one place. Option 2 is
an alternative that can be used to override the strings from the locale is certain conditions you may want to use as part of business logic.

## Managing long translations

There are cases when translations can be long and make components overall look awkward like the `ControlBar` below using strings from a German locale.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <LongTranslationsSnippet />
</Canvas>

We suggest the following options to achieve a better looking interface.

1. Trying less literal translations. If there is a shorter text alternative that does not sacrifice clarity, then that would be an easy option.
2. Using styling to set limits and truncating long translations. The following styling in the example below is passed to each button.

<Source code={TruncationSnippetText} />
<Canvas withSource="none">
  <TruncationSnippet />
</Canvas>

Note: All ACS UI Library components will have aria labels with the full text as part of our Accessibility promise.

3. Using styling to reduce font size.

## Setting rtl

To set rtl of ACS UI Library components for rtl languages, use the `FluentThemeProvider` and set the `rtl` prop to true like in
the example below localized in Arabic.

<Source code={SetRTLSnippetText} />

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <SetRTLSnippet />
</Canvas>
