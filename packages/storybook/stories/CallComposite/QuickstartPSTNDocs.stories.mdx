# Getting Started With PSTN

<DetailedBetaBanner version={'1.3.2-beta.1'} />

The UI Library CallWithChat Composite and Calling Composite supports PSTN by enabling developers to dial and call phone numbers through
Azure Communication Services call service. The UI Library renders a dialpad that supports DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency) and other
features such as being put on hold and dialing in and removing users from an existing call.

More specifically, the following features are supported:

1. [DTMF](./?path=/docs/ui-components-dialpad--dialpad) (dual tone multi-frequency)
2. [Dialpad UI](./?path=/docs/ui-components-dialpad--dialpad)
3. [On/Off hold features](./?path=/docs/composite-adapters--page)
4. 1 to 1 participant PSTN calls
5. Multi participant PSTN calls
6. Dialing/Adding PSTN participants into an existing call
7. Removing PSTN participants from a call

## Download the Code

We will be modifying the composite quickstarts to enable PSTN calling.
Download the [UI Library quickstart composites](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/ui-library-quickstart-composites) to get started.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 16.19.0 and above).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp).
- An identity with VoIP scope. Generate an identity using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).
- A [phone number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) created within the active Communication Service resource.

## Setting Up

### Set Up React App

We'll use the create-react-app template for this quickstart. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

npx create-react-app ui-library-quickstart-composites --template typescript

cd ui-library-quickstart-composites

```

At the end of this process, you should have a full application inside of the folder `ui-library-quickstart-composites`.
For this quickstart, we'll be modifying files inside of the `src` folder.

### Install the Package

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Library for JavaScript.

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-react

```

`@azure/communication-react` specifies core Azure Communication Services as `peerDependencies` so that
you can most consistently use the API from the core libraries in your application. You need to install those libraries as well:

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.6.1-beta.1
npm install @azure/communication-chat@1.2.0

```

### Run Create React App

Let's test the Create React App installation by running:

```bash

npm run start

```

## Get and Manage Phone Numbers

For this quickstart, you are required to provide a [phonenumber](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number)
known as an alternate caller ID from an Azure Communications resource. This phone number serves as your caller ID when calling PSTN.

You can follow the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) to get phone numbers
for PSTN use.

## Initialize Composite

Go to the `src` folder inside of `ui-library-quickstart-composites` and look for the file `App.tsx`.
Here we'll drop the following code to initialize our Composite Components for PSTN Calling using the call adapter.

The adapter requires an [access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/identity-model#access-tokens),
[alternate caller ID](./?path=/docs/composite-adapters--page), and phone number(s) for the call to be setup for PSTN.
For this quickstart, the access tokens required need to have `VoIP` scope.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={QuickstartPSTNSnippet} />

## Run Quickstart

To run the code above use the command:

```bash

npm run start

```

Successfully starting the quickstart will call the phone number(s) provided as seen in the image below.
