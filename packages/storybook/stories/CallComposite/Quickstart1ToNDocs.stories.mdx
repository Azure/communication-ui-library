# Getting Started With 1:N

<DetailedBetaBanner version={'1.3.2-beta.1'} />

The UI Library CallWithChat Composite and Calling Composite supports 1:N by enabling developers to perform outbound calls through
Azure Communication Services call service. Currently, Inbound scenarios (receiving calls from outbound ACS calls) are not supported by our composite level offerings calls.
However, developers are able to build inbound scenarios using our UI Library components and the [Call stateful Client](./?path=/docs/quickstarts-statefulcallclient--page).

The following features are supported:

1. 1:1 outbound calls with ACS users
2. 1:N outbound calls with ACS users
3. 1:N outbound calls with both ACS and PSTN users if an alternate caller Id is provided.
4. [On/Off hold features](?path=/docs/composite-adapters--page)
5. Removing participants from a call

## Download the Code

We will be modifying the composite quickstarts to enable 1:N calling.
Download the [UI Library quickstart composites](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/ui-library-quickstart-composites) to get started.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (Node 16.19.0 and above).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp).
- Identities with VoIP scope. Generate an identity using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).

## Setting Up

### Set Up React App

We'll use the create-react-app template for this quickstart. For more information, see: [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```bash

npx create-react-app ui-library-quickstart-composites --template typescript

cd ui-library-quickstart-composites

```

At the end of this process, you should have a full application inside of the folder `ui-library-quickstart-composites`.
For this quickstart, we'll be modifying files inside of the `src` folder.

### Install the Package

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Library for JavaScript.

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-react

```

`@azure/communication-react` specifies core Azure Communication Services as `peerDependencies` so that
you can most consistently use the API from the core libraries in your application. You need to install those libraries as well:

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.6.1-beta.1
npm install @azure/communication-chat@1.2.0

```

### Run Create React App

Let's test the Create React App installation by running:

```bash

npm run start

```

## Initialize Composite

Go to the `src` folder inside of `ui-library-quickstart-composites` and look for the file `App.tsx`.
Here we'll drop the following code to initialize our Composite Components for 1:N Calling using the call adapter.

The adapter requires an [access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/identity-model#access-tokens),
and ACS User ID's for the call to be setup for 1:N. For this quickstart, the access tokens required need to have `VoIP` scope.

`App.tsx`

<Source code={Quickstart1TonSnippet} />

## Run Quickstart

To run the code above use the command:

```bash

npm run start

```

Successfully starting the quickstart with a Callee userID and access token will call the callee as seen in the preview image below.

## Troubleshooting

See the [troubleshooting page](./?path=/story/troubleshooting--page) for some common problems and recommended solutions.

## Mixing Modalities

UI Library supports mixing PSTN and 1:N modalities into one calling experience. If you wish to develop a scenario where
both is needed, an [alternateCallerId](./?path=/docs/composite-adapters--page) must be provided for the user initiating the call.
If an altnerateCallerId is not provided, then only ACS users are able to be added into the call in a 1:N scenario.

## Setting Up Inbound Calling

The UI Library does not officially support inbound scenarios. However, our Stateful Call Client provides developers a [CallClientState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/communication-react/callclientstate?)
for [incomingCalls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/communication-react/callclientstate#@azure-communication-react-callclientstate-incomingcalls)
to accept and reject calls. This allows developers to create scenarios where their apps can receive calls from outbound 1:N calls using the UI Library.

To set up inbound calling instantiate Stateful Call Client, Call Agent, and Call following the [Stateful Call Client quickstart](./?path=/docs/quickstarts-statefulcallclient--page).

Then subscribe to incoming call events using the Call Agent.

```typescript

import { IncomingCall, IncomingCallEvent } from "@azure/communication-calling";

const [incomingCall, setIncomingCall] = useState<IncomingCall>();
...
useEffect(() => {
  const incomingCallListener: IncomingCallEvent = ({ incomingCall }) => {
    setIncomingCall(incomingCall);
  };
  callAgent.on("incomingCall", incomingCallListener);
  return () => {
    callAgent.off("incomingCall", incomingCallListener);
  };
}, [callAgent]);
```

After subscibing to incoming call events, create callback functions for accepting and rejecting call scenarios using the
[accept](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/incomingcall#@azure-communication-calling-incomingcall-accept)
and [reject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/incomingcall#@azure-communication-calling-incomingcall-reject)
methods provided by the [IncomingCall Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/incomingcall).

```typescript
// Examples for Callback functions for utilizing incomingCall reject and accept.
const onRejectCall = (): void => {
  if (incomingCall) {
    incomingCall.reject();
  }
  setIncomingCall(undefined);
};

const onAcceptCall = async (): Promise<void> => {
  if (incomingCall) {
    const call = await incomingCall.accept();
    onAcceptIncomingCall(call);
  }
  setIncomingCall(undefined);
};
```

Then pass the callback functions to a UI element to accept and reject the calls.
