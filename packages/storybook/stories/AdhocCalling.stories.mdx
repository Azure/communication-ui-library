# Ad-hoc calling

## Overview

A call can be started with a Teams user or a call queue by using their id. You can call a teams user or a Teams voice application
like a call queue or auto attendant. These calls it is important to note can only be one Teams voice application, or multiple teams users. You cannot call multiple
Teams voice applications at the same time.

## Calling a Teams voice application

To call a Teams voice application like a call queue or auto attendant, you need to use the id of the Teams resource account. Check out this [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-teams-auto-attendant#find-object-id-for-auto-attendant) on how to find
this id. The id of the Teams resource account should be stored in the type of `MicrosoftTeamsAppIdentifier[]` and given to the `targetCallees` property
of the [CallAdapter](?path=/docs/composite-adapters--page#calladapter) when creating a call. Now when the [CallComposite](?path=/docs/composites-call-basicexample--basic-example) starts up it will call the Teams voice application
from the configuration screen. See the following snippet for an example.

<MessageBar messageBarType={MessageBarType.warning}>
  Note: Teams resource account ids linked to a call queue need to be in format '28:orgid:UUID' when used in the
  CallParticipantsLocator. For example, '28:orgid:87d349ed-44d7-43e1-9a83-5f2406dee5bd'.
</MessageBar>

The two callback functions `onFetchProfile` and `onFetchAvatarPersonaData` provided at the bottom of the snippet are
for customizing display names and avatars of users, respectively.

## Calling a Teams user

Like a Teams voice application, you can call a Teams user by using their id. The id of the Teams user should be stored in the type of `MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier[]`.
This array should be given to the `targetCallees` property of the [CallAdapter](?path=/docs/composite-adapters--page#calladapter) when creating a call. Like with the bot, the
configuration screen in the CallComposite will call the Teams user. See the following snippet for an example.

<MessageBar messageBarType={MessageBarType.warning}>
  Note: Teams user ids need to be in format '8:orgid:UUID' when used in the CallParticipantsLocator. For example,
  '8:orgid:87d349ed-44d7-43e1-9a83-5f2406dee5bd'.
</MessageBar>

## Obtaining the id of a Teams user or call queue

The id of a Teams user or a call queue can be obtained by using
[Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer).
From there, sign in by clicking the circled button as shown below with a Microsoft account in the same tenant as the
Teams user or call queue you want to call.

<img style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} src="images/graph-api-sign-in.png" />

Then create a
[GET request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#http-request) for
v1.0 of the users endpoint using the Teams user's `userPrincipalName` like shown below:

<img style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} src="images/graph-api-get-user-id-api-request.png" />

If you want to obtain the id for a call queue, use the `userPrincipalName` of Teams resource account linked to the call
queue instead for the GET request above. The id should be in the API response as seen in the example below:

<img style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }} src="images/graph-api-id-highlighted.png" />
