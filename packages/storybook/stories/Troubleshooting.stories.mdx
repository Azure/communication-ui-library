## Project setup errors

### `npm add @azure/communication-react` fails with 'code ERESOLVE'

This error occurs on projects using NPM v7+. The error log looks so:

```
PS C:\tmp\acs\my-react-app> npm add @azure/communication-react
npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
npm ERR! ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree

```

The root cause is that one of @azure/communication-react NPM package's dependencies
specifies an older version of React as a peer dependency than the one installed by default by
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).
Since v7, npm automatically install peer dependencies for packages. This fails because of the existence of the
more recent version of React installed by create-react-app.

**Solution**: We recommend using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when adding the @azure/communication-react dependency, as suggested
by `npm add`.

```
PS C:\tmp\acs\my-react-app> npm add --legacy-peer-deps @azure/communication-react
```
