# Troubleshooting

Guidance for some common problems encountered when building with the Azure Communication Services UI library.

These tips only cover problems you may encounter working with the UI library. For general troubleshooting guidance
for Azure Communication Services, see the [common troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/troubleshooting-info).

## Project setup errors

### `npm add @azure/communication-react` fails with 'code ERESOLVE'

This error occurs on projects using NPM v7+. The error log looks so:

```
PS C:\tmp\acs\my-react-app> npm add @azure/communication-react
npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
npm ERR! ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm ERR!
npm ERR! node_modules/react
npm ERR!   peer react@"17.0.2" from react-dom@17.0.2
npm ERR!   node_modules/react-dom
npm ERR!     peer react-dom@"*" from @testing-library/react@11.2.7

npm ERR! Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry

npm ERR! to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
```

The root cause is that one of @azure/communication-react NPM package's dependencies
specifies an older version of React as a peer dependency than the one installed by default by
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).
Since v7, npm automatically install peer dependencies for packages. This fails because of the existence of the
more recent version of React installed by create-react-app.

**Solution**: We recommend using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when adding the @azure/communication-react dependency, as suggested
by `npm add`.

```
PS C:\tmp\acs\my-react-app> npm add --legacy-peer-deps @azure/communication-react
```

## Project build errors

### Webpack ERROR Unexpected token: `export * as`

```
ERROR in /.../htmlparser2@8.0.1/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib/esm/index.js 59:9
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (59:9)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders
|     return getFeed(parseDOM(feed, options));
| }
> export * as DomUtils from "domutils";
| // Old name for DomHandler
| export { DomHandler as DefaultHandler };
```

This issue will occur when using `@azure/communication-react` with a webpack version < 5.
The best course of action is to upgrade your webpack version to 5.
If this is not possible, take a look at [these workarounds](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/issues/1237#issuecomment-1182522861).

## Runtime errors

### Failed to create call agent, Already exists for this ACS id

```
Uncaught (in promise) CallError: CallClient.createCallAgent: Failed to create call agent, call agent for this ACS Id already exists
    at toCallError (CallContext.ts:739:16)
    at CallContext.eval (CallContext.ts:704:35)
    at Generator.throw (<anonymous>)
    at rejected (CallContext.ts:21:65)
```

We can see this error at times when some calls to construct our `AzureCommunicationCallAdapter` or `StatefulCallClient`. This can be caused by passing the arguments to these functions more than once or too often.

Another common cause for this error is using strict mode in your application. Please see [React's documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) on strict mode to learn more.
