## How does UI Library interact with Rooms

The UI Library helps Contoso create an end user experiences by providing a set of UI components or UI Composite experiences
to join a Rooms call. The UI Library is not for creating users, rooms, and adding users to rooms.

## Examples

Access control for an ACS call are important in many use cases. The scenarios listed below are some very common applications:

- virtual visits (1:1 interactions)
- online class rooms (larger groups)
- presentations
- court trials

To start a rooms call. users need to be created using ACS identities. Learn more about ACS identities [here](/?path=/docs/identity--page).
A room will be created using the Rooms Client. If you are using Javascript, the Rooms Client is imported from this [repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/communication/communication-rooms/)
Then users are added to a room using the Rooms Client with a role.
Once the user is added, the user and their role (which can be retrieved from the Rooms Client) are passed to Call Composite.

## FAQs

### Can the UI Library help me create a room?

No, it only allows a known user to join a room that has been previously set up.
We have quickstarts to allow you to set up a room.

### How do I get a known user to join a room?

That is out of scope but we do have identity quickstarts to set up new users.

### How come some of my buttons are greyed out when I am using the UI composite in the Room?

Depending on your role we only support a subset of capabilities. (E.g a presenter should be able to share their screen
but an attendee should not)

### Is Rooms ready for production loads?

Currently Rooms and the UI Library support for rooms are both in public preview. We definitely look forward to seeing how you
like this experience so we can create an amazing experience when the feature goes "General Available" in 2023.
