## How does UI Library interact with Rooms

The UI Library helps Contoso create end user experiences by providing a set of UI components or UI Composite experiences
to join a rooms call.

## Examples

Rooms can be enhance the call experience in the following applications:

- virtual visits (1:1 interactions)
- online class rooms (larger groups)
- presentations
- court trials

## Where does this fit in your architecture

Create a User. The creation of rooms will be done by Contoso using the Rooms API. The addition of the created user to that room will also use the Rooms API with a role.
The role can be retrieved from the Rooms API and passed to Call composite.

## FAQs

Can the UI Library help me create a room?
No, it only allows a known user to join a room that has been previously set up.
We have quickstarts to allow you to set up a room.

How do I get a known user to join a room?
That is out of scope but we do have identity quickstarts to set up new users.

How come some of my buttons are greyed out when I am using the UI composite in the Room?
Depending on your role we only support a subset of capabilities. (E.g a presenter should be able to share their screen
but an attendee should not)

Is Rooms ready for production loads?
Currently Rooms and the UI Library support for rooms are both in public preview. We definitely look forward to seeing how you
like this experience so we can create an amazing experience when the feature goes "General Available" in 2023.

If I have found any issues with the CallComposite when interacting with a Room where can I go?
