# Join Teams Meeting

<DetailedBetaBanner version={'1.5.1-beta.1'} />

The [join existing call using link](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-jointeamsmeeting--join-teams-meeting) and
[join existing call using meeting Id](./?path=/story/composites-call-with-chat-join-with-meeting-id--join-with-meeting-id) provides an easy
playground to join an existing Azure Communication Services group call or an existing Teams meeting. This is
