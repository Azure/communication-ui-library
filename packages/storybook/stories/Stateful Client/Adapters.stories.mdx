# Adapters for Composites

Composites deliver turn-key communication experiences for developers. 
They make it easy for developers to add end-to-end communication experiences to their apps with only a couple lines of code.
To power Composites, the `communication-react` library provides `Adapters`, one for calling and one for chat Composites.
These adapters make use of the stateful clients for calling and chat in conjunction with React Hooks like usePropsFor, to provide developers a single interface to configure Composites.

## Setting Up Adapters

To setup the adapters, you will need to provide the adapter with key metadata required.
This includes most importantly an access token for your Azure Communication Services resource and context information for the call or chat thread you want to join.

### Calling Adapters

```typescript

```

### Chat Adapter

```typescript
