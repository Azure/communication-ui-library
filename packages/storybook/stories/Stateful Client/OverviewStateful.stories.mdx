# Overview of Stateful Client

Azure Communication Service UI Library exposes stateful clients for calling and chat.
Stateful clients are a 1:1 representation of the `CallClient` and `ChatClient` exposed by the underlying low-level calling and chat SDKs.
They simply add a state layer on top of it to help track state that can be rendered as part of the UI.
They can be used in the same way as low-level clients would be used, so developers can use it to query the service and handle events (i.e. participant added or message recieved).
Stateful clients are agnostic to any specific state management framework.

## Component Binding with Stateful Clients

To make it simpler to connect the stateful client with UI Components, the UI Library exposes helpers, [`usePropsFor`](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-reacthooks-usepropsfor--page), to generate props
These helpers aid in extracting the correct set of props required for different UI Components.
They expose both data for the UI Components to render such as a message list or a participants remote video, and default handlers for UI Components action such as sending a message.

## Installing Stateful Clients

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services UI Library for JavaScript.

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-react

```

`@azure/communication-react` specifies core Azure Communication Services as `peerDependencies` so that
you can most consistently use the API from the core libraries in your application. You need to install those libraries as well:

```bash

npm install @azure/communication-calling@1.10.1
npm install @azure/communication-chat@1.2.0

```

## Calling StatefulClient

Using `createStatefulCallClient`, developer can generate a stateful version of the call client.

```tsx
import { createStatefulCallClient } from '@azure/communication-react';
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from '@azure/communication-common';

const endpointUrl = '<ENDPOINT>';
const userAccessToken = '<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>';
const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userAccessToken);

const statefulCallClient = createStatefulCallClient({
  userId: userId,
});

// You can then use the `statefulCallClient` in the same way as a `CallClient` with a slight variation.

const callAgent = await statefulCallClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential, {displayName: 'Optional User Name'})

const call = callAgent.join({groupId: <GUID>})

```

To interact with the call, developers have access to `statefulCallClient` and `CallAgent`. The stateful clients are a 1:1 representation.
For state to be tracked, developers should use the stateful clients to query the service and listen to events.

### Accessing the Device Manager

Through the `statefulCallClient`, developers can access the device manager to query the device available for the call.

```tsx
const deviceManager = await statefulCallClient.getDeviceManager();
```

The device manager allows developers to access the local video stream to render for the user ahead of joining a call.

```tsx
const cameras = await deviceManager.getCameras();
const camera = cameras[0];
const localCameraStream = { source: camera, mediaStreamType: 'Video' } as LocalVideoStreamState;
const { view } = await statefulClient.createView(localCameraStream);
```

For more information on the `DeviceManager`, see [Device Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/devicemanager?view=azure-communication-services-js)

## Chat StatefulClient

Using the `createStatefulChatClient`, developer can generate a stateful version of the chat client.

```tsx
import { createStatefulChatClient } from '@azure/communication-react';
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from '@azure/communication-common';

const endpointUrl = '<ENDPOINT>';
const userAccessToken = '<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>';
const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userAccessToken);

const statefulChatClient = createStatefulChatClient({
  userId: userId,
  displayName: displayName,
  endpoint: endpointUrl,
  credential: tokenCredential
});

// You can then use the `statefulChatClient` in the same way as a `ChatClient` with a slight variation.

const chatThreadClient = await statefulChatClient.createChatThread({});
```

To interact with the chat thread, developers have access `statefulChatClient` and `chatThreadClient`. The stateful clients are a 1:1 representation.
For state to be tracked, developers should use the stateful clients to query the service and listen to events.

### Access the Chat Thread Client

The Chat Thread Client allows developers to access a variety of methods to query participants and send messages to a thread.

```tsx
const sendMessageRequest = {
  content: 'Hello! Can you share the deck for the conference?'
};

let sendMessageOptions = {
  senderDisplayName: 'Jack',
  type: 'text'
};
const sendChatMessageResult = await chatThreadClient.sendMessage(sendMessageRequest, sendMessageOptions);
const messageId = sendChatMessageResult.id;
```

For more information on the `ChatThreadClient`, see [ChatThreadClient](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-communication-chat/1.0.0/classes/chatthreadclient.html)

## Capabilities

Stateful clients enable developers to access all the APIs that low-level calling and chat SDKs expose.
For a complete list of capabilities see [Calling Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features) and
[Chat Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/chat/sdk-features).
At a high level, stateful clients allow developers the following capabilities.

| Capabilities               | Example                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read state                 | Query the state `statefulClient.state` to access properties such as `statefulClient.state.messsages`               |
| Handle state event changes | Subscribe to events `statefulClient.onStateChange()` and unsubscribe from events `statefulClient.offStateChange()` |
| Send commands              | Mute the microphone `statefulClient.mute()`                                                                        |
