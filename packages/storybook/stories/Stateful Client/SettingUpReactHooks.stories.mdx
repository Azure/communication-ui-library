# Hooks

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) allows developers to use state and other react features without writing a class component.

While you can choose any state management library such as Redux, we also provide a simple way to power react components with our Stateful SDK. We provide two [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) in our library, [usePropsFor()](#usePropsFor) and [useSelector()](#useSelector), that allow you to subscribe to changes in the SDK state and bind to our UI components. After binding with the custom hooks a SDK state change will trigger a re-render of the UI component, and events on the component will call into the SDK clients.

## Before you start

Before you start, you need to wrap your whole App with Providers. They give you access to global variables (like Stateful ChatClient/CallClient) for our hooks to consume. There are different Providers for building apps with varying functionality:

### Chat

For your Chat app, use the `ChatClientProvider` and `ChatThreadClientProvider` to give hooks access to the `ChatClient` and `ChatThreadClient`. `StatefulChatClient` and `StatefulChatThreadClient` instances need to be passed to the Provider when you wrap your app, check [ChatSDKIntroduction]() to see how to create them.

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <ChatClientProvider chatClient={statefulChatClient}>
    <ChatThreadClientProvider chatThreadClient={statefulChatThreadClient}>
      <App />
    <ChatThreadClientProvider>
  </ChatClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
