# Hooks

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) allows developers to use state and other react features without writing a class component.

While you can choose any state management library such as Redux, we also provide a simple way to power react components with our Stateful SDK.
We provide two [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) in our library, [usePropsFor()](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-reacthooks-usepropsfor--page) and [useSelector()](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-reacthooks-useselector--page), that allow you to subscribe to changes in the SDK state and bind to our UI components.
After binding with the custom hooks a SDK state change will trigger a re-render of the UI component, and events on the component will call into the SDK clients.

## Before you Start

Before you start, you need to wrap your whole App with Providers.
They give you access to global variables (like Stateful ChatClient/CallClient) for our hooks to consume.
There are different Providers for building apps with varying functionality:

### Chat

For your Chat app, use the `ChatClientProvider` and `ChatThreadClientProvider` to give hooks access to the `ChatClient` and `ChatThreadClient`.
`statefulChatClient` and `chatThreadClient` instances need to be passed to the Provider when you wrap your app.
For more information on creating them, see [Overview](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-overview--page)

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <ChatClientProvider chatClient={statefulChatClient}>
    <ChatThreadClientProvider chatThreadClient={ChatThreadClient}>
      <App />
    </ChatThreadClientProvider>
  </ChatClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Calling

For your Chat app, use the `CallClientProvider`, `CallAgentProvider` and `CallProvider` to give hooks access to the `CallClient`, `CallAgentClient` and `Call`.
`statefulCallClient`, `callAgent` and `call` instances need to be passed to the Provider when you wrap your app.
For more information on creating them, see [Overview](./?path=/docs/statefulclient-overview--page)

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <CallClientProvider callClient={statefulCallClient}>
    <CallAgentProvider callAgent={callAgent}>
      <CallProvider call={call}>
        <App />
      </CallProvider>
    </CallAgentProvider>
  </CallClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Next

Once you have wrapped your entire app with providers, you are now can use the usePropsFor() method inside of your app to connect your components to the state.
