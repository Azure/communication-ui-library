# PowerPoint Live Integration with Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services (ACS) integrate PowerPoint Live into Teams meetings, enhancing the presentation experience. This feature allows real-time engagement with presentations, making it an invaluable tool for various scenarios.

## Roles in a PowerPoint Live Session

Within a PowerPoint Live session, participants are categorized into roles, each with specific capabilities:

- **Presenter**: Leads the session, controlling the presentation flow.
- **Attendee**: Views the presentation, with interaction capabilities defined by the Presenter. This is the default role.

The distinct capabilities for each role are detailed in the [PowerPoint Live documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-from-powerpoint-live-in-microsoft-teams-28b20e74-7165-499c-9bd4-0ad975d448ad).

PowerPoint Live is ideally suited for:

- Corporate presentations
- Educational lectures
- Remote training sessions
- Webinars

## Implementing the Stateful Client API for PowerPoint Live

The Stateful Client API from ACS UI Library simplifies managing the state and lifecycle of your communication features within an application. Follow the steps outlined in the [Stateful Client Quickstart](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/quickstarts-statefulcallclient--page) to initialize the Stateful Call Client.

## Implementing the VideoGallery Component for PowerPoint Live

To display the PowerPoint Live session, utilize the VideoGallery component, which can also serve for showing video streams or screen shares, including PowerPoint presentations shared by a presenter.

### VideoGallery Setup

Integrate the VideoGallery component by following the guide in the [VideoGallery Documentation](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery). This component allows you to render video streams or shared content within your application seamlessly.

```typescript
// Import the necessary dependencies
import { VideoGallery } from '@azure/communication-react';

// Use the VideoGallery component to display the presentation
function PPTLiveComponent() {
  // Setup screenShareStream under remoteParticipants
  return <VideoGallery localParticipant={localParticipant} remoteParticipants={remoteParticipants} />;
}
```
