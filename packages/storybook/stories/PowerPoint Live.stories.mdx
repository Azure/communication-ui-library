# PowerPoint Live

Azure Communication Services (ACS) integrate PowerPoint Live into Teams meetings, enhancing the presentation experience. This feature allows real-time engagement with presentations, making it an invaluable tool for various scenarios.

## Overview

In the ACS UI library, users participate as attendees to view PowerPoint Live sessions. The interaction capabilities for attendees are set and controlled by the lead presenter of the session.

For a detailed breakdown of the capabilities available to each role during a PowerPoint Live session, please refer to the [PowerPoint Live documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-from-powerpoint-live-in-microsoft-teams-28b20e74-7165-499c-9bd4-0ad975d448ad). For more technical details on how to implement these features using the web calling SDK, consult the [Calling SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features).

Some of the best use cases for PowerPoint Live are:

- Corporate presentations
- Educational lectures
- Remote training sessions
- Webinars

## Implementing with the VideoGallery

The VideoGallery component is used to display PowerPoint Live sessions. This multi-functional component also supports video streams and screen sharing. Hereâ€™s a brief guide to integrating it:

<Source code={PPTLiveSnippetText} />

This code snippet illustrates the utilization of the `usePropsFor` hook from the `@azure/communication-react` package, which dynamically manages the properties of the `VideoGallery`. This ensures that the component reacts appropriately to changes in state or properties.

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [VideoGallery](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery). This component facilitates the seamless integration of video streams or shared content into your application.
