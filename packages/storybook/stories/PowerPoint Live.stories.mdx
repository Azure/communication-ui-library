# PowerPoint Live

Azure Communication Services (ACS) integrate PowerPoint Live into Teams meetings, enhancing the presentation experience. This feature allows real-time engagement with presentations, making it an invaluable tool for various scenarios.

## Overview

In the ACS UI library, users participate as attendees to view PowerPoint Live sessions. The interaction capabilities for attendees are set and controlled by the lead presenter of the session.

For a detailed breakdown of the capabilities available to each role during a PowerPoint Live session, please refer to the [PowerPoint Live documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-from-powerpoint-live-in-microsoft-teams-28b20e74-7165-499c-9bd4-0ad975d448ad). For more technical details on how to implement these features using the web calling SDK, consult the [Calling SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features).

PowerPoint Live is ideally suited for:

- Corporate presentations
- Educational lectures
- Remote training sessions
- Webinars

## Implementing with the VideoGallery Components

The VideoGallery component is used to display PowerPoint Live sessions. This multi-functional component also supports video streams and screen sharing. Hereâ€™s a brief guide to integrating it:

```typescript
// Import the necessary dependencies
import { VideoGallery } from '@azure/communication-react';

// Use the VideoGallery component to display the presentation
function PPTLiveComponent() {
  // Definition of a mock object simulating a PowerPoint live stream.
  const mockPptLiveStream = {
    isAvailable: true,
    renderElement: call.features(pptLive).targetElement as HTMLElement
  };
  // An array of mock remote participants in a video call.
  // Set mockPptLiveStream under screenShareStream.
  const remoteParticipants = [
    {
      userId: 'user1',
      displayName: 'Peter Parker',
      isScreenSharingOn: true,
      screenShareStream: mockPptLiveStream
    }
  ];
  // Functional component demonstrating the integration of PowerPoint live sharing in a video call interface.
  return <VideoGallery localParticipant={localParticipant} remoteParticipants={remoteParticipants} />;
}
```

For more detailed setup instructions, see the [VideoGallery Documentation](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery). This component allows you to render video streams or shared content within your application seamlessly.
