# Northstar Wrapper for React 18 interim support

In order to support React 18, we need all dependencies to support React 18.

This package is a wrapper around the `@northstar-ui/react` package that will allow us to use React 18 without having to wait for all dependencies to support React 18.

This should be a _temporary_ solution until dependencies support React 18 or we migrate to a different fluent version.
