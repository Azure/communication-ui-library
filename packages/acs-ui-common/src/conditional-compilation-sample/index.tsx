/**
 * This folder contains some simple examples using conditional compilation directive.
 *
 * They are intended to be a cheet-sheat when you're trying to figure out how to make conditional compilation work for you.
 *
 * Just like the rest of the code in this repository, this module can be built for both flavored builds:
 *
 * To build for beta (i.e. without any code removed by conditional compilation):
 *
 * ```bash
 *   rush switch-flavor:beta  # This is also the default
 *   rush build -t .
 * ``
 *
 * To build for stable (i.e. marked code conditionally removed):
 *
 * ```bash
 *   rush switch-flavor:stable
 *   rush build -t .
 * ```
 *
 * In the latter case, you can see the transformed code in `packages/acs-ui-common/preprocessed/conditional-compilation-sample/`.
 *
 * General guidelines:
 * 1. Keep conditional compilation as small as possible.
 * 2. Keep conditional compilation encapsulated.
 * 3. Keep conditional compilation near package boundary.
 *   a. If the conditional compilation is in our exported API, try to quickly convert to a type that is not conditional.
 *      This will often simplify implementation.
 *   b. If the conditional compilation is to deal with a dependency, try to quickly fill in a default value so that you
 *      don't need conditional compilation at point-of-use.
 *
 * (1) is not always possible (depends on the feature you're working on), but (3) can help you make the footprint smaller, and
 * (2) can help you keep the footprint sane.
 *
 * Organization of this file:
 * - First let's talk types
 * - Then let's talk conditional business logic
 * - Finally, let's bring those together in some repeated patterns we see in this code-base.
