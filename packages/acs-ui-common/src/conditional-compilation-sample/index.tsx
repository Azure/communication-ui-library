/**
 * This folder contains some simple examples using conditional compilation directive.
 *
 * They are intended to be a cheet-sheat when you're trying to figure out how to make conditional compilation work for you.
 *
 * Just like the rest of the code in this repository, this module can be built for both flavored builds:
 *
 * To build for beta (i.e. without any code removed by conditional compilation):
 *
 * ```bash
 *   rush switch-flavor:beta  # This is also the default
 *   rush build -t .
 * ``
 *
 * To build for stable (i.e. marked code conditionally removed):
 *
 * ```bash
 *   rush switch-flavor:stable
 *   rush build -t .
 * ```
 *
 * In the latter case, you can see the transformed code in `packages/acs-ui-common/preprocessed/conditional-compilation-sample/`.
 *
 * General guidelines:
 * 1. Keep conditional compilation as small as possible.
 * 2. Keep conditional compilation encapsulated.
 * 3. Keep conditional compilation near package boundary.
 *   a. If the conditional compilation is in our exported API, try to quickly convert to a type that is not conditional.
 *      This will often simplify implementation.
 *   b. If the conditional compilation is to deal with a dependency, try to quickly fill in a default value so that you
 *      don't need conditional compilation at point-of-use.
 *
 * (1) is not always possible (depends on the feature you're working on), but (3) can help you make the footprint smaller, and
 * (2) can help you keep the footprint sane.
 *
 * Organization of this file:
 * - First let's talk types
 * - Then let's talk conditional business logic
 * - Finally, let's bring those together in some repeated patterns we see in this code-base.

/**
 * Add a parameter to an existing function
 *
 * We do not support adding a parameter to a function _implementation_ signature.
 * But we do support conditional parameters in function overload signature.
 *
 * So there are two ways to achieve this:
 * - Add a single overload signature with conditional parameter: `f` in the example.
 * - Add a new overload signature with conditional paramter: `f` and `g` in the example.
 *
 * In each case, you must modify the implementation signature to satisfy all the overloads.
 * The example does this by adding `f` and `g` as optional parameters.
 *
 * cf: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#function-overloads.

 * Note how the selector has a conditional field in the *return type* and the *implementation*, but does not have a conditional
 * dependency (and hence no conditional argument). This follows from the principle that conditional compilation should be restricted
 * to be as close to the API boundary as possible -- we require the selector's type to not include the new field in stable flavored builds,
 * but there is no reason that the internal argument list can't contain the extra (and unused) dependency on a new selector.
