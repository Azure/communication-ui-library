/**
 * A custom React hook to manage the lifecycle of a cancellable async task
 * cooperatively.
 *
 * This hook may be useful when a component needs to run some task
 * asynchronously that may need to be later cancelled.
 *
 * - Task cancellation is cooperative. The triggered action must check for task
 *   cancellation at appropriate points and return early when cancelled.
 * - There can be only one task in progress at any time. Triggering a second
 *   task cancels the previously triggered task, if it exists.
 *
 * ## Example
 * ```ts
 * const [triggerFunc, cancelFunc] = useCancellableTask();
 *
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   // Some asynchronous task that needs to be triggered (but not waited upon).
 *   triggerFunc(async (cancellable: Cancellable) => {
 *     // Task cancellation is cooperative. The following blocking call is not
 *     // cancellable (it does not take the cancellable argument at all). So
 *     // any cancellation will only take effect once this call is await'ed.
 *     const costlyBlockingCallReturn = await costlyBlockingCall(someArg);
 *
 *     // Cooperative cancellation.
 *     if (cancellable.cancelled) {
 *       return;
 *     }
 *
 *     // If not cancelled, continue. The most common scenario is setting some
 *     // state variable from the parent component.
 *     setCostlyValue(costlyBlockingCallReturn)
 *   });
 *
 *   // There can be many reasons to cancel the task.
 *   // In this example, the task is canceled before the useEffect runs again.
 *   // Strictly speaking this is unnecessary because triggering another task
 *   // would automatically cancel previously triggered task.
 *   return () => {
 *     cancelFunc();
 *   }
 * }, [someArg]);
 * ```
