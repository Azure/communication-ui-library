 *logic: Looking at message A, how do we know it's read number?
 * Assumption: if user read the latest message, user has read all messages before that
 * ReadReceipt behaviour: read receipt is only sent to the last message
 *
 * If participant read a message that is sent later than message A, then the participant has read message A
 * How do we check if the message is sent later than message A?
 * We compare if the messageID of the last read message is larger than or equal to the message A's id
 * Because messageID is the creation timestamp of each message
 * Timestamps are in epoch time so lecixographical ordering is the same as time ordering.
 *
 * if MessageId of B is larger than message Id of A, then B is created after A
 * if the last read message is created after the message A is sent, then user should have read message A as well */
