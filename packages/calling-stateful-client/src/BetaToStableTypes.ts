// This is for mapping new types from beta, which does not exist in stable sdk.
// These mappings are necessary to bypass type check of conditional compilation
// Remove these types when the feature get stabilized in stable sdk

// For example, CallCommon doesn't exist in stable call sdk, so it will be still Call type
// So we remove CallCommonBeta type in stable
// In beta, Call | CallCommon = CallCommon because Call is just a super set of CallCommon
