# useMicrophone

The `useMicrophone` hook allows users to get the current state of their microphone, mute, and unmute their microphone.
To help developers, we have also added the ability to toggle (mute/unmute) their microphone. This hook accounts for
debouncing in the case users continually mute/unmute their microphone in a short span of time. Technically this hook
can be optional if you join the meeting "unmuted" and you don't want to enable users to mute themselves.
