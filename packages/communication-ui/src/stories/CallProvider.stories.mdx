# CallProvider

The CallProvider holds the context for a specific ACS call. It is used with CallingProvider to help create the overall context required to start an ACS call.
This combination of CallingProvider and CallProvider enables child components to have the correct information for generating a calling experience. These concepts
are separated as its possible to create an experience of multiple video calls as well while using the same base information in the CallingProvider.

```jsx
<CallingProvider token="<TOKEN>", displayName="<DISPLAYNAME>", groupId="<GROUPID>">
   <CallProvider>
      // call 1
   </CallProvider>
</CallingProvider>
```

In contrast to the CallingProvider, CallProvider maintains context for the call, participants in the call, information about how the user can interact
on the call, the video streams associated with the call.

## Importing

```javascript
import { CallProvider } from '@azure/acs-ui-sdk';
```

- useCamera
- useGroupCall
- useTeamsCall

## Caveats

- Must be a used as a descendant of CallingProvider

## Usage

TBD
