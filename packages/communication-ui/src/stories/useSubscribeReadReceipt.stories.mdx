# useSubscribeReadReceipt

The `useSubscribeReadReceipt` hook allows components to subscribe to read receipt events. The hook takes in an optional
callback of the form `(readReceipts: ReadReceipt[]) => void` which will be called when a read receipt has been
received. If the callback was not provided then by default the hook will add the read receipts to ChatThreadProvider's
context. Note that this must be called even if you want to use the default behavior of having read receipts set to
ChatThreadProvider's context.
