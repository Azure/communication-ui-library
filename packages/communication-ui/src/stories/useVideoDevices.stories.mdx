# useVideoDevices

The `useVideoDevices` hook allows users retrieve their video device list, their currently selected video device, and allows you to select a different
video device. This hook is used if you want to be able to choose another video device (e.g camera). This hook is technically optional.
If you don't use this hook, the first video device is selected. It will also trigger a permission dialog if the user has not granted camera
permission to the application. If the user denies access, the list of "video devices" will be empty and thus no video device info can be selected.
