# Azure Communication Services - UI Toolkit

Azure Communication Services - UI Toolkit makes it easy for you to build modern communications user experiences. It gives you a library of production-ready UI components that you can drop into your applications:

- **Composites** - These are turn-key solutions that implement common communication scenarios. You can quickly add video calling or chat experiences to your applications. Composites are open-source higher order components built using UI components.

- **UI Components** - These components are open-source building blocks that let you build custom communications experience. Components are offered for both calling and chat capabilities that can be combined to build experiences.
  These UI client libraries all use Microsoft's Fluent design language and assets. Fluent UI provides a foundational layer for the UI Framework that has been battle tested across Microsoft products.
