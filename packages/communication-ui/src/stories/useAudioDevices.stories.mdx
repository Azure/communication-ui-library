# useAudioDevices

The `useAudioDevices` hook allows users retrieve their audio device list, their currently selected audio device, and allows you to select a different
audio device. This hook is used if you want to be able to choose another audio device (e.g microphone). This hook is technically optional.
If you don't use this hook, the first audio device is selected. It will also trigger a permission dialog if the user has not granted microphone
permission to the application. If the user denies access, the list of "audio devices" will be empty and thus no audio device info can be selected.
