# CallingProvider

The CallingProvider sets up the base context for one or many ACS calls. It takes in more general information over call specific information (e.g access token, user name, etc).
The CallingProvider must exist if users want to do ACS calls. It does not handle the context for any specific call. Individual calling scenarios should also be wrapped with
a CallProvider. We have both CallingProvider and CallProvider concepts since we wanted to distinguish state around the calling experience and individual call instances.

```jsx
<CallingProvider token="<TOKEN>", displayName="<DISPLAYNAME>", groupId="<GROUPID>">
   <CallProvider>
      // call 1
   </CallProvider>
</CallingProvider>
```

In addition to maintaining general ACS information, the CallingProvider also maintains context for DeviceManager, CallAgent, and the CallClient. This abstraction allows
developers to focus on setting up device permissions, cameras, microphones, and any other concepts shared between your one or many calls. A great example of using the CallingProvider
without a CallProvider is setting up a screen for participants to preview their local stream prior to joining a call. In this example, we could show available camera, microphones and
if given permission, we could use a camera and generate a local preview for the participant.

## Importing

```javascript
import { CallingProvider } from '@azure/communication-ui';
```

## Hooks

These hooks are dependant on the CallingProvider

- useAudioDevices
- useVideoDevices
- useDevicePermission
- useLocalVideoStreamRenderer
- useMicrophone
- useScreenShare

These hooks are dependant on the CallingProvider and a CallProvider

- useCallAgent
- useCamera
- useGroupCall
- useTeamsCall

* useRemoteVideoStreamRenderer

## Caveats

- There can only be one CallingProvider at a time in your react application
- You must remove the CallingProvider from your React application if you are using the ACS Calling SDK directly.

## Usage

TBD
