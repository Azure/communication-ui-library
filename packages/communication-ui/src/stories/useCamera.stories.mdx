# useCamera

The `useCamera` hook provides functionality around the camera, specifically around local video streams.
This hook helps to retrieve/set the current local video stream and how to share and how to stop sharing your local stream
with other participants on the call. This hook also exposes if the hook is busy creating a local video stream. If you want
to share your camera, this hook is necessary. If you are just doing an audio call, this hook is not necessary.
