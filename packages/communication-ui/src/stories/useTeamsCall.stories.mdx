# useTeamsCall

The `useTeamsCall` hook allows components to leverage the underlying Calling JS SDK to join a Microsoft Teams meeting. This hook is necessary if you want to join an existing
Teams Meeting.

In order to use this hook, the teams meeting link will need to be provided. When joining via this flow the user will be anonymous and will need to be invited into the call.

## Caveats

There is a call state that is used here since the user needs to be invited in. Developers should implement a state of the call known as 'lobby'

## Importing

```javascript
import { useTeamsCall } from '@azure/communication-ui';
```

## Dependencies

- CallingProvider

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  CallingProvider,
  useTeamsCall
} from '@azure/communication-ui';

const Example = () => (
  <CallingProvider token="<TOKEN>", displayName="<DISPLAYNAME>", groupId="<GROUPID>">
      <App />
  </CallingProvider>
);

const App = () => {
  const {join, leave} = useTeamsCall();

  useEffect(() => {
    join('sample meeting link'/* teams meeting link */)
  }, [])
}
```
