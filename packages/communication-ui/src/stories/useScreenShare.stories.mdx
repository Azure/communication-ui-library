# useScreenShare

The `useScreenShare` hook allows users to get the current state of their screen sharing, start, and stop their screen sharing.
To help developers, we have also added the ability to toggle on and off their current screen sharing state. This hook accounts for
debouncing in the case users continually activate/disable screen sharing in a short span of time. This hook is only necessary if you
want to have screen sharing capabilities exposed via the calling sdk. If you don't need screensharing, you don't need this hook.
