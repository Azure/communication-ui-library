# ChatProvider

The ChatProvider sets up the base context for one or many ACS chat threads. It takes in more general information over chat thread specific information (e.g access token, user name, etc).
The ChatProvider is necessary but not sufficient for setting up acs chat threads. It does not handle the context for any specific chat thread. Individual chat threads should also
be wrapped with a ChatThreadProvider. We have both ChatProvider and ChatThreadProvider concepts since we wanted to distinguish state around the overall chat experience and the
chat thread instance.

```jsx
<ChatProvider token="<TOKEN>", displayName="<DISPLAYNAME>", threadId="<THREADID>", endpointUrl="<ENDPOINTURL>">
   <ChatThreadProvider>
      // chat thread 1
   </ChatThreadProvider>
</ChatProvider>
```

## Importing

```javascript
import { ChatProvider } from '@azure/communication-ui';
```

## Hooks

These hooks are dependant on ChatProvider

- useSubscribeTypingNotification
- useTypingUsers

These hooks are dependant on ChatProvider and ChatThreadProvider

- useFetchThread
- useFetchThreadMembers
- useSubscribeMessage
- useSendTypingNotification

## Caveats

- There can only be one ChatProvider at a time in your react application
- At this time we only support one ChatThreadProvider descendant under the ChatProvider

## Usage

TBD
