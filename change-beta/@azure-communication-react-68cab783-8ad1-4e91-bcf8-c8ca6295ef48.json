  "comment": "We are excited to announce that the Azure Communication Services Web UI Library now supports the Soft Mute feature. This feature enables users to mute other users in a call. If a user has been soft muted, they retain the ability to unmute themselves. Developers can use this functionality today through our composites (e.g CallComposite, CallWithChatComposite) as well as through components (e.g VideoGallery).",
