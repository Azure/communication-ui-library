  "comment": "The UI Library now supports End of Call survey, with the feature added to the CallComposite and CallwithChatComposite on web. The survey supports feedback for the categories of overall quality, audio, video, and screenshare. This survey appears at the end of composite experience. By default, users are taken to a “thank you for your feedback” page after survey is submitted, and taken to the end call screen if survey is skipped. We provide abilities to overwrite those default screens. The survey can be disabled or enabled. The data received is sent to Contoso’s local Azure monitoring where it can be validated for overall call quality. When free form text survey is enabled, the free form text data collected are not sent to local Azure monitoring and will need to be handled by Contoso.",
