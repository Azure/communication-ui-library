        # Before pushing changes to origin, merge any intervening changes on the upstream branch.
        # This allows multiple snapshot update jobs in this action to run concurrently.
        # - The only files updated locally are UI snapshots
        # - Each job is responsible for a unique set of UI snapshots
        # Thus we do not expect any merge conflicts due to the concurrent jobs from this workflows.
        #
        # If the UI snapshots are updated in the upstream branch while this job was running
        # (e.g., due to a merge from the base_ref for a PR), this merge will fail, and the
        # workflow will have to be triggered again. This is the desired behavior because the workflow
        # should not silently overwrite updates to the target branch.
