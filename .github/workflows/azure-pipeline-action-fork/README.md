# GitHub Action to trigger a run in Azure pipelines

GitHub Actions makes it easy to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. 

However, if you would like to use your GH Action workflows just for CI and for CD, continue to use your favorite [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/pipelines/) with all the best-in-class features needed to enable compliant, safe deployments to their prod Environments, it is quite possible with this azure/pipelines action.

With this action, you could trigger an Azure pipeline run right from inside an Action workflow.

The definition of this Github Action is in [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/pipelines/blob/master/action.yml).

## Sample workflow 

Use this action to trigger a specific pipeline (YAML or Classic Release Pipeline) in an Azure DevOps organization.
Action takes Project URL, pipeline name and a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops) for your DevOps account.

```yaml
- uses: Azure/pipelines@v1
  with:
    azure-devops-project-url: 'https://dev.azure.com/organization/project-name'
    azure-pipeline-name: 'pipeline-name' # name of the Azure pipeline to be triggered
    azure-devops-token: '${{ secrets.AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN }}'
    azure-pipeline-variables:  '{"variable1": "value1", "variable2": "value2"}' # optional stringified json
```
